<p class='mt2'>The present edition includes some epigrams
from &ldquo;A Little Book in C Major,&rdquo; now out of
print. To make room for them several of the
smaller sketches in the first edition have been
omitted. Nearly the whole contents of the book
appeared originally in <i>The Smart Set</i>. The references
to a Europe not yet devastated by war
and an America not yet polluted by Prohibition
show that some of the pieces first saw print in
far better days than these.</p>

<i>I.&mdash;Death. A Philosophical
Discussion</i></h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><i>The back parlor of any average American
home. The blinds are drawn and
a single gas-jet burns feebly. A dim
suggestion of festivity: strange chairs,
the table pushed back, a decanter and glasses.
A heavy, suffocating, discordant scent of
flowers&mdash;roses, carnations, lilies, gardenias. A
general stuffiness and mugginess, as if it were
raining outside, which it isn&rsquo;t.</i></p>

<p><i>A door leads into the front parlor. It is
open, and through it the flowers may be seen.
They are banked about a long black box with
huge nickel handles, resting upon two folding
horses. Now and then a man comes into the
front room from the street door, his shoes
squeaking hideously. Sometimes there is a
woman, usually in deep mourning. Each visitor
approaches the long black box, looks into
it with ill-concealed repugnance, snuffles softly,
and then backs of toward the door. A clock
on the mantel-piece ticks loudly. From the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>street come the usual noises&mdash;a wagon rattling,
the clang of a trolley car&rsquo;s gong, the shrill cry
of a child.</i></p>

<p><i>In the back parlor six pallbearers sit upon
chairs, all of them bolt upright, with their
hands on their knees. They are in their Sunday
clothes, with stiff white shirts. Their hats
are on the floor beside their chairs. Each
wears upon his lapel the gilt badge of a fraternal
order, with a cr&ecirc;pe rosette. In the
gloom they are indistinguishable; all of them
talk in the same strained, throaty whisper. Between
their remarks they pause, clear their
throats, blow their noses, and shuffle in their
chairs. They are intensely uncomfortable.
Tempo: Adagio lamentoso, with occasionally a
rise to andante maesto. So:</i></p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Who woulda thought that <i>he</i> woulda been
the next?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; you never can tell.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>(<i>An oldish voice, oracularly.</i>) We&rsquo;re here
to-day and gone to-morrow.</p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>I seen him no longer ago than Chewsday.
He never looked no better. Nobody would
have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>I seen him Wednesday. We had a glass of
beer together in the Huffbrow Kaif. He was
laughing and cutting up like he always done.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>You never know who it&rsquo;s gonna hit next.
Him and me was pallbearers together for Hen
Jackson no more than a month ago, or say five
weeks.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Well, a man is lucky if he goes off quick.
If I had <i>my</i> way I wouldn&rsquo;t want no better way.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>My brother John went thataway. He
dropped like a stone, settin&rsquo; there at the supper
table. They had to take his knife out of
his hand.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>I had an uncle to do the same thing, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>without the knife. He had what they call appleplexy.
It runs in my family.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>They say it&rsquo;s in <i>his&rsquo;n</i>, too.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>But he never looked it.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>No. Nobody woulda thought <i>he</i> woulda
been the next.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Them are the things you never can tell anything
about.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t it true!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re here to-day and gone to-morrow.</p>

<p>(<i>A pause. Feet are shuffled. Somewhere
a door bangs.</i>)</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>Brightly.</i>) He looks elegant. I hear he
never suffered none.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>No; he went too quick. One minute he was
alive and the next minute he was dead.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Think of it: dead so quick!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Gone!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>Passed away!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>Well, we all have to go <i>some</i> time.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; a man never knows but what his turn&rsquo;ll
come next.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t tell nothing by looks. Them sickly
fellows generally lives to be old.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; the doctors say it&rsquo;s the big stout person
that goes off the soonest. They say typhord
never kills none but the healthy.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>So I have heered it said. My wife&rsquo;s youngest
brother weighed 240 pounds. He was as
strong as a mule. He could lift a sugar-barrel,
and then some. Once I seen him drink damn
near a whole keg of beer. Yet it finished him
in less&rsquo;n three weeks&mdash;and <i>he</i> had it mild.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>It seems that there&rsquo;s a lot of it this fall.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; I hear of people taken with it every
day. Some say it&rsquo;s the water. My brother
Sam&rsquo;s oldest is down with it.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>I had it myself once. I was out of my head
for four weeks.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; you don&rsquo;t die as long as you&rsquo;re out of
your head.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>It seems to me that there is a lot of sickness
around this year.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>I been to five funerals in six weeks.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>I beat you. I been to six in five weeks, not
counting this one.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>A body don&rsquo;t hardly know what to think of
it scarcely.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>That.rss what <i>I</i> always say: you can&rsquo;t tell
who&rsquo;ll be next.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t it true! Just think of <i>him</i>.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; nobody woulda picked <i>him</i> out.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>Nor my brother John, neither.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>Well, what <i>must</i> be <i>must</i> be.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; it don&rsquo;t do no good to kick. When a
man&rsquo;s time comes he&rsquo;s got to go.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re lucky if it ain&rsquo;t us.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>So I always say. We ought to be thankful.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way <i>I</i> always feel about it.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t do <i>him</i> no good, no matter <i>what</i>
we done.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re here to-day and gone to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s hard all the same.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard on <i>her</i>.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes, it is. Why should <i>he</i> go?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a question nobody ain&rsquo;t ever answered.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>Nor never won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right there. I talked to a preacher
about it once, and even <i>he</i> couldn&rsquo;t give no answer
to it.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>The more you think about it the less you can
make it out.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>When I seen him last Wednesday he had
no more ideer of it than what you had.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Well, if I had <i>my</i> choice, that&rsquo;s the way I
would always want to die.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> say. I am with you there.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; you&rsquo;re right, both of you. It don&rsquo;t do
no good to lay sick for months, with doctors&rsquo;
bills eatin&rsquo; you up, and then have to go anyhow.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>No; when a thing has to be done, the best
thing to do is to get it done and over with.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just what I said to my wife when I
heerd.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>But nobody hardly thought that <i>he</i> woulda
been the next.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>No; but that&rsquo;s one of them things you can&rsquo;t
tell.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>You never know <i>who&rsquo;ll</i> be the next.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s lucky you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>I guess you&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fourth Pallbearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what my grandfather used to say:
you never know what is coming.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Fifth Pallbearer</p>

<p>Yes; that&rsquo;s the way it goes.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Sixth Pallbearer</p>

<p>First one, and then somebody else.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>First Pallbearer</p>

<p>Who it&rsquo;ll be you can&rsquo;t say.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Second Pallbearer</p>

<p><i>I</i> always say the same: we&rsquo;re here to-day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>Third Pallbearer</p>

<p>(<i>Cutting in jealousy and humorously.</i>) And
to-morrow we ain&rsquo;t here.</p>

<p>(<i>A subdued and sinister snicker. It is followed
by sudden silence. There is a shuffling
of feet in the front room, and whispers. Necks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>are craned. The pallbearers straighten their
backs, hitch their coat collars and pull on their
black gloves. The clergyman has arrived.
From above comes the sound of weeping.</i>)</p>

<p><i>"Ruhm und Ewigkeit" (Fame and Eternity),
a symphonic poem in B flat minor, Opus
48, by Johann Sigismund Timotheus Albert
Wolfgang Kraus (1872-&nbsp;&nbsp;).</i></p>

<p class="noin">Kraus, like his eminent compatriot,
Dr. Richard Strauss, has gone to
Friedrich Nietzsche, the laureate of
the modern German tone-art, for his
inspiration in this gigantic work. His text is
to be found in Nietzsche&rsquo;s <i>Ecce Homo</i>, which
was not published until after the poet&rsquo;s death,
but the composition really belongs to <i>Also
sprach Zarathustra</i>, as a glance will show:</p>

<p>The composition is scored for three flutes,
one piccolo, one bass piccolo, seven oboes,
one English horn, three clarinets in D flat, one
clarinet in G flat, one corno de bassetto, three
bassoons, one contra-bassoon, eleven horns,
three trumpets, eight cornets in B, four trombones,
two alto trombones, one viol da gamba,
one mandolin, two guitars, one banjo, two tubas,
glockenspiel, bell, triangle, fife, bass-drum,
cymbals, timpani, celesta, four harps, piano,
harmonium, pianola, phonograph, and the
usual strings.</p>

<p>At the opening a long B flat is sounded by
the cornets, clarinets and bassoons in unison,
with soft strokes upon a kettle-drum tuned to
G sharp. After eighteen measures of this,
<i>singhiozzando</i>, the strings enter <i>pizzicato</i> with
a figure based upon one of the scales of the ancient
Persians&mdash;B flat, C flat, D, E sharp, G
and A flat&mdash;which starts high among the first
violins, and then proceeds downward, through
the second violins, violas and cellos, until it is
lost in solemn and indistinct mutterings in the
double-basses. Then, the atmosphere of doom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>having been established, and the conductor having
found his place in the score, there is heard
the motive of brooding, or as the German commentators
call it, the <i>Qu&auml;lerei Motiv</i>:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-031.png" width="400" height="380" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>The opening chord of the eleventh is sounded
by six horns, and the chords of the ninth,
which follow, are given to the woodwind. The
rapid figure in the second measure is for solo
violin, heard softly against the sustained interval
of the diminished ninth, but the final G natural
is snapped out by the whole orchestra
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><i>sforzando</i>. There follows a rapid and daring
development of the theme, with the flutes
and violoncellos leading, first harmonized with
chords of the eleventh, then with chords of the
thirteenth, and finally with chords of the fifteenth.
Meanwhile, the tonality has moved
into D minor, then into A flat major, and then
into G sharp minor, and the little arpeggio for
the solo violin has been augmented to seven, to
eleven, and in the end to twenty-three notes.
Here the influence of Claude Debussy shows itself;
the chords of the ninth proceed by the
same chromatic semitones that one finds in the
<i>Chansons de Bilitis</i>. But Kraus goes much further
than Debussy, for the tones of his chords
are constantly altered in a strange and extremely
beautiful manner, and, as has been noted,
he adds the eleventh, thirteenth and fifteenth.
At the end of this incomparable passage there
is a sudden drop to C major, followed by the
first statement of the <i>Missgeschick Motiv</i>, or
motive of disaster (misfortune, evil destiny, untoward
fate):</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-032.png" width="400" height="88" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>This graceful and ingratiating theme will
give no concern to the student of Ravel and
Schoenberg. It is, in fact, a quite elemental
succession of intervals of the second, all produced
by adding the ninth to the common
chord&mdash;thus: C, G, C, D, E&mdash;with certain enharmonic
changes. Its simplicity gives it, at a
first hearing, a placid, pastoral aspect, somewhat
disconcerting to the literalist, but the discerning
will not fail to note the mutterings beneath
the surface. It is first sounded by two
violas and the viol da gamba, and then drops
without change to the bass, where it is repeated
<i>fortissimo</i> by two bassoons and the contra-bassoon.
The tempo then quickens and the two
themes so far heard are worked up into a brief
but tempestuous fugue. A brief extract will
suffice to show its enormously complex nature:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-033.png" width="400" height="536" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>A pedal point on B flat is heard at the end
of this fugue, sounded <i>fortissimo</i> by all the
brass in unison, and then follows a grand pause,
twelve and a half measures in length. Then,
in the strings, is heard the motive of warning:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-034.png" width="400" height="250" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Out of this motive comes the harmonic material
for much of what remains of the composition.
At each repetition of the theme, the
chord in the fourth measure is augmented by
the addition of another interval, until in the
end it includes every tone of the chromatic scale
save C sharp. This omission is significant of
Kraus&rsquo; artistry. If C sharp were included the
tonality would at once become vague, but without
it the dependence of the whole gorgeous edifice
upon C major is kept plain. At the end,
indeed, the tonic chord of C major is clearly
sounded by the wood-wind, against curious triplets,
made up of F sharp, A flat and B flat in
various combinations, in the strings; and from
it a sudden modulation is made to C minor, and
then to A flat major. This opens the way for
the entrance of the motive of lamentation, or,
as the German commentators call it, the <i>Schreierei
Motiv</i>:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-035.png" width="400" height="90" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>This simple and lovely theme is first sounded,
not by any of the usual instruments of the
grand orchestra, but by a phonograph in B flat,
with the accompaniment of a solitary trombone.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>When the composition was first played at the
Gewandhaus in Leipzig the innovation caused
a sensation, and there were loud cries of sacrilege
and even proposals of police action. One
indignant classicist, in token of his ire, hung
a wreath of <i>Knackw&uuml;rste</i> around the neck of
the bust of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Thomaskirche,
and appended to it a card bearing the
legend, <i>Schweinehund</i>! But the exquisite beauty
of the effect soon won acceptance for the means
employed to attain it, and the phonograph has
so far made its way with German composers
that Prof. Ludwig Grossetrommel, of G&ouml;ttingen,
has even proposed its employment in
opera in place of singers.</p>

<p>This motive of lamentation is worked out
on a grand scale, and in intimate association
with the motives of brooding and of warning.
Kraus is not content with the ordinary materials
of composition. His creative force is always
impelling him to break through the fetters
of the diatonic scale, and to find utterance
for his ideas in archaic and extremely exotic
tonalities. The pentatonic scale is a favorite
with him; he employs it as boldly as Wagner
did in <i>Das Rheingold</i>. But it is not enough,
for he proceeds from it into the Dorian mode
of the ancient Greeks, and then into the Phrygian,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>and then into two of the plagal modes.
Moreover, he constantly combines both unrelated
scales and antagonistic motives, and invests
the combinations in astounding orchestral
colors, so that the hearer, unaccustomed to
such bold experimentations, is quite lost in the
maze. Here, for example, is a characteristic
passage for solo French horn and bass piccolo:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-037a.png" width="400" height="96" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>The dotted half notes for the horn obviously
come from the motive of brooding, in
augmentation, but the bass piccolo part is new.
It soon appears, however, in various fresh aspects,
and in the end it enters into the famous
quadruple motive of &ldquo;sulphur-yellow truth&rdquo;&mdash;<i>schwefelgelbe
Wahrheit</i>, as we shall presently
see. Its first combination is with a jaunty figure
in A minor, and the two together form what
most of the commentators agree upon denominating
the Zarathustra motive:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-037b.png" width="400" height="104" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>I call this the Zarathustra motive, following
the weight of critical opinion, but various influential
critics dissent. Thus, Dr. Ferdinand
Bierfisch, of the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik at Dresden,
insists that it is the theme of &ldquo;the elevated
mood produced by the spiritual isolation and
low barometric pressure of the mountains,&rdquo;
while Prof. B. Moll, of Frankfurt a/M., calls
it the motive of prowling. Kraus himself,
when asked by Dr. Fritz Bratsche, of the Berlin
<i>Volkszeitung</i>, shrugged his shoulders and
answered in his native Hamburg dialect, &ldquo;<i>So
gehts im Leben! &rsquo;S giebt gar kein Use</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Such
is life; it gives hardly any use (to inquire?).
In much the same way Schubert made
reply to one who asked the meaning of the
opening subject of the slow movement of his
C major symphony: &ldquo;<i>Halt&rsquo;s Maul, du verfluchter
Narr!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Don&rsquo;t ask such question, my
dear sir!</p>

<p>But whatever the truth, the novelty and originality
of the theme cannot be denied, for it is
in two distinct keys, D major and A minor,
and they preserve their identity whenever it
appears. The handling of two such diverse tonalities
at one time would present insuperable
difficulties to a composer less ingenious than
Kraus, but he manages it quite simply by founding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>his whole harmonic scheme upon the tonic
triad of D major, with the seventh and ninth
added. He thus achieves a chord which also
contains the tonic triad of A minor. The same
thing is now done with the dominant triads, and
half the battle is won. Moreover, the instrumentation
shows the same boldness, for the
double theme is first given to three solo violins,
and they are muted in a novel and effective
manner by stopping their F holes. The directions
in the score say <i>mit Glaserkitt</i> (that is,
with glazier&rsquo;s putty), but the Konzertmeister
at the Gewandhaus, Herr F. Dur, substituted
ordinary pumpernickel with excellent results.
It is, in fact, now commonly used in the German
orchestras in place of putty, for it does
less injury to the varnish of the violins, and,
besides, it is edible after use. It produces a
thick, oily, mysterious, far-away effect.</p>

<p>At the start, as I have just said, the double
theme of Zarathustra appears in D major and
A minor, but there is quick modulation to B
flat major and C sharp minor, and then to C
major and F sharp minor. Meanwhile the
tempo gradually accelerates, and the polyphonic
texture is helped out by reminiscences of the
themes of brooding and of lamentation. A sudden
hush and the motive of warning is heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>high in the wood-wind, in C flat major, against
a double organ-point&mdash;C natural and C sharp&mdash;in
the lower strings. There follows a cadenza
of no less than eighty-four measures for
four harps, tympani and a single tuba, and
then the motive of waiting is given out by the
whole orchestra in unison:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-040.png" width="400" height="84" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>This stately motive is repeated in F major,
after which some passage work for the piano
and pianola, the former tuned a quarter tone
lower than the latter and played by three performers,
leads directly into the quadruple
theme of the sulphur-yellow truth, mentioned
above. It is first given out by two oboes divided,
a single English horn, two bassoons in
unison, and four trombones in unison. It is
an extraordinarily long motive, running to
twenty-seven measures on its first appearance;
the four opening measures are given on the
next page.</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-041.png" width="400" height="588" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>With an exception yet to be noted, all of the
composer&rsquo;s thematic material is now set forth,
and what follows is a stupendous development
of it, so complex that no written description
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>could even faintly indicate its character. The
quadruple theme of the sulphur-yellow truth is
sung almost uninterruptedly, first by the wood-wind,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>then by the strings and then by the full
brass choir, with the glockenspiel and cymbals
added. Into it are woven all of the other
themes in inextricable whirls and whorls of
sound, and in most amazing combinations and
permutations of tonalities. Moreover, there is
a constantly rising complexity of rhythm, and
on one page of the score the time signature is
changed no less than eighteen times. Several
times it is 5-8 and 7-4; once it is 11-2; in one
place the composer, following Koechlin and
Erik Satie, abandons bar-lines altogether for
half a page of the score. And these diverse
rhythms are not always merely successive;
sometimes they are heard together. For example,
the motive of disaster, augmented to 5-8
time, is sounded clearly by the clarinets against
the motive of lamentation in 3-4 time, and
through it all one hears the steady beat of the
motive of waiting in 4-4!</p>

<p>This gigantic development of materials is
carried to a thrilling climax, with the whole
orchestra proclaiming the Zarathustra motive
<i>fortissimo</i>. Then follows a series of arpeggios
for the harps, made of the motive of warning,
and out of them there gradually steals the tonic
triad of D minor, sung by three oboes. This
chord constitutes the backbone of all that follows.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>The three oboes are presently joined by
a fourth. Against this curtain of tone the flutes
and piccolos repeat the theme of brooding in
F major, and then join the oboes in the D minor
chord. The horns and bassoons follow with
the motive of disaster and then do likewise.
Now come the violins with the motive of lamentation,
but instead of ending with the D
minor tonic triad, they sound a chord of the
seventh erected on C sharp as seventh of D
minor. Every tone of the scale of D minor
is now being sounded, and as instrument after
instrument joins in the effect is indescribably
sonorous and imposing. Meanwhile, there is
a steady <i>crescendo</i>, ending after three minutes
of truly tremendous music with ten sharp blasts
of the double chord. A moment of silence and
a single trombone gives out a theme hitherto
not heard. It is the theme of tenderness, or,
as the German commentators call it, the <i>Biermad&rsquo;l
Motiv</i>: Thus:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-043.png" width="400" height="165" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Again silence. Then a single piccolo plays
the closing cadence of the composition:</p>

<div class='c'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-044.png" width="400" height="107" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p><i>Ruhm und Ewigkeit</i> presents enormous difficulties
to the performers, and taxes the generalship
of the most skillful conductor. When
it was in preparation at the Gewandhaus the
first performance was postponed twelve times
in order to extend the rehearsals. It was reported
in the German papers at the time that
ten members of the orchestra, including the first
flutist, Ewald L&ouml;wenhals, resigned during the
rehearsals, and that the intervention of the
King of Saxony was necessary to make them
reconsider their resignations. One of the second
violins, Hugo Zehndaumen, resorted to
stimulants in anticipation of the opening performance,
and while on his way to the hall was
run over by a taxicab. The conductor was
Nikisch. A performance at Munich followed,
and on May 1, 1913, the work reached Berlin.
At the public rehearsal there was a riot led by
members of the Bach Gesellschaft, and the hall
was stormed by the mounted police. Many arrests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>were made, and five of the rioters were
taken to hospital with serious injuries. The
work was put into rehearsal by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in 1914. The rehearsals have
been proceeding ever since. A piano transcription
for sixteen hands has been published.</p>

<p>Kraus was born at Hamburg on January
14, 1872. At the age of three he performed
creditably on the zither, cornet and trombone,
and by 1877 he had already appeared in concert
at Danzig. His family was very poor, and
his early years were full of difficulties. It is
said that, at the age of nine, he copied the
whole score of Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Ring</i>, the scores of
the nine Beethoven symphonies and the complete
works of Mozart. His regular teacher,
in those days, was Stadtpfeifer Schmidt, who
instructed him in piano and thorough-bass. In
1884, desiring to have lessons in counterpoint
from Prof. Kalbsbraten, of Mainz, he walked
to that city from Hamburg once a week&mdash;a distance
for the round trip of 316 miles. In 1887
he went to Berlin and became fourth cornetist
of the Philharmonic Orchestra and valet to
Dr. Schweinsrippen, the conductor. In Berlin
he studied violin and second violin under the
Polish virtuoso, Pbyschbrweski, and also had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>lessons in composition from Wilhelm Geigenheimer,
formerly third triangle and assistant
librarian at Bayreuth.</p>

<p>His first composition, a march for cornet,
violin and piano, was performed on July 18,
1888, at the annual ball of the Arbeiter Liedertafel
in Berlin. It attracted little attention,
but six months later the young composer made
musical Berlin talk about him by producing a
composition called <i>Adenoids</i>, for twelve tenors,
<i>a cappella</i>, to words by Otto Julius Bierbaum.
This was first heard at an open air concert
given in the Tiergarten by the Sozialist Liederkranz.
It was soon after repeated by the choir
of the Gottesgelehrheitsakademie, and Kraus
found himself a famous young man. His string
quartet in G sharp minor, first played early in
1889 by the quartet led by Prof. Rudolph
Wurst, added to his growing celebrity, and
when his first tone poem for orchestra, <i>Fuchs,
Du Hast die Gans Gestohlen</i>, was done by the
Philharmonic in the autumn of 1889, under Dr.
Lachschinken, it was hailed with acclaim.</p>

<p>Kraus has since written twelve symphonies
(two choral), nine tone-poems, a suite for brass
and tympani, a trio for harp, tuba and glockenspiel,
ten string quartettes, a serenade for flute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>and contra-bassoon, four concert overtures, a
cornet concerto, and many songs and piano
pieces. His best-known work, perhaps, is his
symphony in F flat major, in eight movements.
But Kraus himself is said to regard this huge
work as trivial. His own favorite, according
to his biographer, Dr. Linsensuppe, is <i>Ruhm
und Ewigkeit</i>, though he is also fond of the
tone-poem which immediately preceded it,
<i>Rinderbrust und Meerrettig</i>. He has written
a choral for sixty trombones, dedicated to Field
Marshal von Hindenburg, and is said to be
at work on a military mass for four orchestras,
seven brass bands and ten choirs, with the usual
soloists and clergy. Among his principal
works are <i>Der Ewigen Wiederkunft</i> (a ten
part fugue for full orchestra), <i>Biergem&uuml;tlichkeit</i>,
his <i>Oberkellner</i> and <i>Uebermensch</i> concert
overtures, and his setting (for mixed chorus)
of the old German hymn:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Kraus is now a resident of Munich, where
he conducts the orchestra at the L&ouml;wenbr&auml;uhaus.
He has been married eight times and
is at present the fifth husband of Tilly Heintz,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>the opera singer. He has been decorated by
the Kaiser, by the King of Sweden and by the

not quite fashionable. That is to say, most of

lamenting it. They have, taking one with another,
about three children apiece, and are good
mothers. A few of them belong to women&rsquo;s
clubs or flirt with the suffragettes, but the majority
can get all of the intellectual stimulation
they crave in the Ladies&rsquo; Home Journal and the
Saturday Evening Post, with Vogue added for
its fashions. Most of them, deep down in their
hearts, suspect their husbands of secret frivolity,
and about ten per cent. have the proofs, but
it is rare for them to make rows about it, and
the divorce rate among them is thus very low.
Themselves indifferent cooks, they are unable
to teach their servants the art, and so the food
they set before their husbands and children is
often such as would make a Frenchman cut
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>his throat. But they are diligent housewives
otherwise; they see to it that the windows are
washed, that no one tracks mud into the hall,
that the servants do not waste coal, sugar, soap
and gas, and that the family buttons are always
sewed on. In religion these estimable wives
are pious in habit but somewhat nebulous in
faith. That is to say, they regard any person
who specifically refuses to go to church as a
heathen, but they themselves are by no means
regular in attendance, and not one in ten of
them could tell you whether transubstantiation
is a Roman Catholic or a Dunkard doctrine.
About two per cent. have dallied more or less
gingerly with Christian Science, their average
period of belief being one year.</p>

<p>The church we are in is like the neighborhood
and its people: well-to-do but not fashionable.
It is Protestant in faith and probably
Episcopalian. The pews are of thick, yellow-brown
oak, severe in pattern and hideous in
color. In each there is a long, removable cushion
of a dark, purplish, dirty hue, with here and
there some of its hair stuffing showing. The
stained-glass windows, which were all bought
ready-made and depict scenes from the New
Testament, commemorate the virtues of departed
worthies of the neighborhood, whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>names appear, in illegible black letters, in the
lower panels. The floor is covered with a carpet
of some tough, fibrous material, apparently
a sort of grass, and along the center aisle it is
much worn. The normal smell of the place is
rather less unpleasant than that of most other
halls, for on the one day when it is regularly
crowded practically all of the persons gathered
together have been very recently bathed.</p>

<p>On this fine morning, however, it is full of
heavy, mortuary perfumes, for a couple of florist&rsquo;s
men have just finished decorating the chancel
with flowers and potted palms. Just behind
the chancel rail, facing the center aisle,
there is a prie-dieu, and to either side of it are
great banks of lilies, carnations, gardenias and
roses. Three or four feet behind the prie-dieu
and completely concealing the high altar, there
is a dense jungle of palms. Those in the front
rank are authentically growing in pots, but behind
them the florist&rsquo;s men have artfully placed
some more durable, and hence more profitable,
sophistications. Anon the rev. clergyman,
emerging from the vestry-room to the right,
will pass along the front of this jungle to the
prie-dieu, and so, framed in flowers, face the
congregation with his saponaceous smile.</p>

<p>The florist&rsquo;s men, having completed their labors,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>are preparing to depart. The older of
the two, a man in the fifties, shows the ease
of an experienced hand by taking out a large
plug of tobacco and gnawing off a substantial
chew. The desire to spit seizing him shortly,
he proceeds to gratify it by a trick long practised
by gasfitters, musicians, caterer&rsquo;s helpers,
piano movers and other such alien invaders of
the domestic hearth. That is to say, he hunts
for a place where the carpet is loose along the
chancel rail, finds it where two lengths join,
deftly turns up a flap, spits upon the bare floor,
and then lets the flap fall back, finally giving
it a pat with the sole of his foot. This done,
he and his assistant leave the church to the
sexton, who has been sweeping the vestibule,
and, after passing the time of day with the two
men who are putting up a striped awning from
the door to the curb, disappear into a nearby
speak-easy, there to wait and refresh themselves
until the wedding is over, and it is time to take
away their lilies, their carnations and their synthetic
palms.</p>

<p>It is now a quarter past eleven, and two flappers
of the neighborhood, giggling and arm-in-arm,
approach the sexton and inquire of him
if they may enter. He asks them if they have
tickets and when they say they haven&rsquo;t, he tells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>them that he ain&rsquo;t got no right to let them in,
and don&rsquo;t know nothing about what the rule is
going to be. At some weddings, he goes on,
hardly nobody ain&rsquo;t allowed in, but then again,
sometimes they don&rsquo;t scarcely look at the tickets
at all. The two flappers retire abashed, and as
the sexton finishes his sweeping, there enters the
organist.</p>

<p>The organist is a tall, thin man of melancholy,
ur&aelig;mic aspect, wearing a black slouch hat
with a wide brim and a yellow overcoat that
barely reaches to his knees. A pupil, in his
youth, of a man who had once studied (irregularly
and briefly) with Charles-Marie Widor,
he acquired thereby the artistic temperament,
and with it a vast fondness for malt liquor.
His mood this morning is acidulous and depressed,
for he spent yesterday evening in a
Pilsner ausschank with two former members
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and it was
3 A. M. before they finally agreed that Johann
Sebastian Bach, all things considered, was a
greater man than Beethoven, and so parted
amicably. Sourness is the precise sensation
that wells within him. He feels vinegary; his
blood runs cold; he wishes he could immerse
himself in bicarbonate of soda. But the call
of his art is more potent than the protest of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>his poisoned and quaking liver, and so he manfully
climbs the spiral stairway to his organ-loft.</p>

<p>Once there, he takes off his hat and overcoat,
stoops down to blow the dust off the organ keys,
throws the electrical switch which sets the bellows
going, and then proceeds to take off his
shoes. This done, he takes his seat, reaches
for the pedals with his stockinged feet, tries an
experimental 32-foot CCC, and then wanders
gently into a Bach toccata. It is his limbering-up
piece: he always plays it as a prelude to a
wedding job. It thus goes very smoothly and
even brilliantly, but when he comes to the end
of it and tackles the ensuing fugue he is quickly
in difficulties, and after four or five stumbling
repetitions of the subject he hurriedly improvises
a crude coda and has done. Peering down
into the church to see if his flounderings have
had an audience, he sees two old maids enter,
the one very tall and thin and the other somewhat
brisk and bunchy.</p>

<p>They constitute the vanguard of the nuptial
throng, and as they proceed hesitatingly up the
center aisle, eager for good seats but afraid to
go too far, the organist wipes his palms upon
his trousers legs, squares his shoulders, and
plunges into the program that he has played at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>all weddings for fifteen years past. It begins
with Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Spring Song, pianissimo.
Then comes Rubinstein&rsquo;s Melody in F, with a
touch of forte toward the close, and then
Nevin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oh, That We Two Were Maying&rdquo;
and then the Chopin waltz in A flat, Opus 69,
No. 1, and then the Spring Song again, and
then a free fantasia upon &ldquo;The Rosary&rdquo; and
then a Moszkowski mazurka, and then the
Dvor&aacute;k Humoresque (with its heart-rending
cry in the middle), and then some vague and
turbulent thing (apparently the disjecta membra
of another fugue), and then Tschaikowsky&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Autumn,&rdquo; and then Elgar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Salut d&rsquo;Amour,&rdquo;
and then the Spring Song a third
time, and then something or other from one
of the Peer Gynt suites, and then an hurrah or
two from the Hallelujah chorus, and then
Chopin again, and Nevin, and Elgar, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But meanwhile, there is a growing activity
below. First comes a closed automobile bearing
the six ushers and soon after it another automobile
bearing the bridegroom and his best
man. The bridegroom and the best man disembark
before the side entrance of the church
and make their way into the vestry room, where
they remove their hats and coats, and proceed
to struggle with their cravats and collars before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>a mirror which hangs on the wall. The
room is very dingy. A baize-covered table is
in the center of it, and around the table stand
six or eight chairs of assorted designs. One
wall is completely covered by a bookcase,
through the glass doors of which one may discern
piles of cheap Bibles, hymn-books and
back numbers of the parish magazine. In one
corner is a small washstand. The best man
takes a flat flask of whiskey from his pocket,
looks about him for a glass, finds it on the
washstand, rinses it at the tap, fills it with a policeman&rsquo;s
drink, and hands it to the bridegroom.
The latter downs it at a gulp. Then the best
man pours out one for himself.</p>

<p>The ushers, reaching the vestibule of the
church, have handed their silk hats to the sexton,
and entered the sacred edifice. There
was a rehearsal of the wedding last night, but
after it was over the bride ordered certain incomprehensible
changes in the plan, and the
ushers are now completely at sea. All they
know clearly is that the relatives of the bride
are to be seated on one side and the relatives
of the bridegroom on the other. But which
side for one and which for the other? They
discuss it heatedly for three minutes and then
find that they stand three for putting the bride&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>relatives on the left side and three for putting
them on the right side. The debate, though instructive,
is interrupted by the sudden entrance
of seven women in a group. They are headed
by a truculent old battleship, possibly an aunt
or something of the sort, who fixes the nearest
usher with a knowing, suspicious glance, and
motions to him to show her the way.</p>

<p>He offers her his right arm and they start
up the center aisle, with the six other women
following in irregular order, and the five other
ushers scattered among the women. The leading
usher is tortured damnably by doubts as
to where the party should go. If they are
aunts, to which house do they belong, and on
which side are the members of that house to be
seated? What if they are not aunts, but merely
neighbors? Or perhaps an association of
former cooks, parlor maids, nurse girls? Or
strangers? The sufferings of the usher are
relieved by the battleship, who halts majestically
about twenty feet from the altar, and
motions her followers into a pew to the left.
They file in silently and she seats herself next
the aisle. All seven settle back and wriggle
for room. It is a tight fit.</p>

<p>(Who, in point of fact, are these ladies?
Don&rsquo;t ask the question! The ushers never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>find out. No one ever finds out. They
remain a joint mystery for all time. In
the end they become a sort of tradition, and
years hence, when two of the ushers meet, they
will cackle over old dreadnaught and her six
cruisers. The bride, grown old and fat, will
tell the tale to her daughter, and then to her
granddaughter. It will grow more and more
strange, marvelous, incredible. Variorum versions
will spring up. It will be adapted to
other weddings. The dreadnaught will become
an apparition, a witch, the Devil in skirts.
And as the years pass, the date of the episode
will be pushed back. By 2017 it will be dated
1150. By 2475 it will take on a sort of sacred
character, and there will be a footnote referring
to it in the latest Revised Version of the
New Testament.)</p>

<p>It is now a quarter to twelve, and of a sudden
the vestibule fills with wedding guests.
Nine-tenths of them, perhaps even nineteen-twentieths,
are women, and most of them are
beyond thirty-five. Scattered among them,
hanging on to their skirts, are about a dozen
little girls&mdash;one of them a youngster of eight
or thereabout, with spindle shanks and shining
morning face, entranced by her first wedding.
Here and there lurks a man. Usually he wears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>a hurried, unwilling, protesting look. He has
been dragged from his office on a busy morning,
forced to rush home and get into his cut-away
coat, and then marched to the church by
his wife. One of these men, much hustled,
has forgotten to have his shoes shined. He
is intensely conscious of them, and tries to
hide them behind his wife&rsquo;s skirt as they walk
up the aisle. Accidentally he steps upon it,
and gets a look over the shoulder which lifts
his diaphragm an inch and turns his liver to
water. This man will be courtmartialed when
he reaches home, and he knows it. He wishes
that some foreign power would invade the
United States and burn down all the churches
in the country, and that the bride, the bridegroom
and all the other persons interested in
the present wedding were dead and in hell.</p>

<p>The ushers do their best to seat these wedding
guests in some sort of order, but after
a few minutes the crowd at the doors becomes
so large that they have to give it up, and thereafter
all they can do is to hold out their right
arms ingratiatingly and trust to luck. One of
them steps on a fat woman&rsquo;s skirt, tearing it
very badly, and she has to be helped back to
the vestibule. There she seeks refuge in a
corner, under a stairway leading up to the steeple,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>and essays to repair the damage with pins
produced from various nooks and crevices of
her person. Meanwhile the guilty usher stands
in front of her, mumbling apologies and trying
to look helpful. When she finishes her
work and emerges from her improvised dry-dock,
he again offers her his arm, but she
sweeps past him without noticing him, and proceeds
grandly to a seat far forward. She is
a cousin to the bride&rsquo;s mother, and will make
a report to every branch of the family that all
six ushers disgraced the ceremony by appearing
at it far gone in liquor.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes are consumed by such episodes
and divertisements. By the time the
clock in the steeple strikes twelve the church
is well filled. The music of the organist, who
has now reached Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Spring Song
for the third and last time, is accompanied by
a huge buzz of whispers, and there is much
craning of necks and long-distance nodding and
smiling. Here and there an unusually gorgeous
hat is the target of many converging
glances, and of as many more or less satirical
criticisms. To the damp funeral smell of the
flowers at the altar, there has been added the
cacodorous scents of forty or fifty different
brands of talcum and rice powder. It begins
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>to grow warm in the church, and a number of
women open their vanity bags and duck down
for stealthy dabs at their noses. Others, more
reverent, suffer the agony of augmenting shines.
One, a trickster, has concealed powder in her
pocket handkerchief, and applies it dexterously
while pretending to blow her nose.</p>

<p>The bridegroom in the vestry-room, entering
upon the second year (or is it the third?)
of his long and ghastly wait, grows increasingly
nervous, and when he hears the organist
pass from the Spring Song into some more
sonorous and stately thing he mistakes it for
the wedding march from &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; and is
hot for marching upon the altar at once. The
best man, an old hand, restrains him gently,
and administers another sedative from the bottle.
The bridegroom&rsquo;s thoughts turn to gloomy
things. He remembers sadly that he will never
be able to laugh at benedicts again; that his
days of low, rabelaisian wit and care-free scoffing
are over; that he is now the very thing
he mocked so gaily but yesteryear. Like a
drowning man, he passes his whole life in review&mdash;not,
however, that part which is past,
but that part which is to come. Odd fancies
throng upon him. He wonders what his honeymoon
will cost him, what there will be to drink
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>at the wedding breakfast, what a certain girl
in Chicago will say when she hears of his marriage.
Will there be any children? He rather
hopes not, for all those he knows appear so
greasy and noisy, but he decides that he might
conceivably compromise on a boy. But how
is he going to make sure that it will not be a
girl? The thing, as yet, is a medical impossibility&mdash;but
medicine is making rapid strides.
Why not wait until the secret is discovered?
This sapient compromise pleases the bridegroom,
and he proceeds to a consideration of
various problems of finance. And then, of a
sudden, the organist swings unmistakably into
&ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; and the best man grabs him by
the arm.</p>

<p>There is now great excitement in the church.
The bride&rsquo;s mother, two sisters, three brothers
and three sisters-in-law have just marched up
the center aisle and taken seats in the front
pew, and all the women in the place are craning
their necks toward the door. The usual
electrical delay ensues. There is something the
matter with the bride&rsquo;s train, and the two
bridesmaids have a deuce of a time fixing it.
Meanwhile the bride&rsquo;s father, in tight pantaloons
and tighter gloves, fidgets and fumes in
the vestibule, the six ushers crowd about him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>inanely, and the sexton rushes to and fro like
a rat in a trap. Finally, all being ready, with
the ushers formed two abreast, the sexton
pushes a button, a small buzzer sounds in the
organ loft, and the organist, as has been said,
plunges magnificently into the fanfare of the
"Lohengrin" march. Simultaneously the sexton
opens the door at the bottom of the main
aisle, and the wedding procession gets under
weigh.</p>

<p>The bride and her father march first. Their
step is so slow (about one beat to two measures)
that the father has some difficulty in
maintaining his equilibrium, but the bride herself
moves steadily and erectly, almost seeming
to float. Her face is thickly encrusted with
talcum in its various forms, so that she is almost
a dead white. She keeps her eyelids lowered
modestly, but is still acutely aware of
every glance fastened upon her&mdash;not in the
mass, but every glance individually. For example,
she sees clearly, even through her eyelids,
the still, cold smile of a girl in Pew 8 R&mdash;a
girl who once made an unwomanly attempt
upon the bridegroom&rsquo;s affections, and was routed
and put to flight by superior strategy. And
her ears are open, too: she hears every &ldquo;How
sweet!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh, lovely!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>pale!&rdquo; from the latitude of the last pew to the
very glacis of the altar of God.</p>

<p>While she has thus made her progress up
the hymeneal chute, the bridegroom and his
best man have emerged from the vestryroom
and begun the short march to the prie-dieu.
They walk haltingly, clumsily, uncertainly,
stealing occasional glances at the advancing
bridal party. The bridegroom feels of his
lower right-hand waistcoat pocket; the ring
is still there. The best man wriggles his cuffs.
No one, however, pays any heed to them. They
are not even seen, indeed, until the bride and
her father reach the open space in front of the
altar. There the bride and the bridegroom
find themselves standing side by side, but not a
word is exchanged between them, nor even a
look of recognition. They stand motionless,
contemplating the ornate cushion at their feet,
until the bride&rsquo;s father and the bridesmaids file
to the left of the bride and the ushers, now
wholly disorganized and imbecile, drape themselves
in an irregular file along the altar rail.
Then, the music having died down to a faint
murmur and a hush having fallen upon the assemblage,
they look up.</p>

<p>Before them, framed by foliage, stands the
reverend gentleman of God who will presently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>link them in indissoluble chains&mdash;the estimable
rector of the parish. He has got there just in
time; it was, indeed, a close shave. But no
trace of haste or of anything else of a disturbing
character is now visible upon his smooth,
glistening, somewhat feverish face. That face
is wholly occupied by his official smile, a thing
of oil and honey all compact, a balmy, unctuous
illumination&mdash;the secret of his success in life.
Slowly his cheeks puff out, gleaming like soap-bubbles.
Slowly he lifts his prayer-book from
the prie-dieu and holds it droopingly. Slowly
his soft caressing eyes engage it. There is an
almost imperceptible stiffening of his frame.
His mouth opens with a faint click. He begins
to read.</p>

<p>The Ceremony of Marriage has begun.</p></div>

over a ticklish place, &ldquo;I daresay this
pile of rocks will last. It has cost me
a pretty penny, believe me. I made
up my mind at the start that it would be built
of honest stone, or not at all. No cheap and
shoddy brickwork for <i>me</i>! Look at Babylon.
It&rsquo;s all brick, and it&rsquo;s always tumbling down.
My ambassador there tells me that it costs a
million a year to keep up the walls alone&mdash;mind
you, the walls alone! What must it cost
to keep up the palace, with all that fancy work!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grant you that brickwork <i>looks</i> good.
But what of it? So does a cheap cotton night-shirt&mdash;you
know the gaudy things those Theban
peddlers sell to my sand-hogs down on the
river bank. But does it <i>last</i>? Of course it
doesn&rsquo;t. Well, I am putting up this pyramid
to <i>stay</i> put, and I don&rsquo;t give a damn for its
looks. I hear all sorts of funny cracks about
it. My barber is a sharp nigger and keeps his
ears open: he brings me all the gossip. But I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>let it go. This is <i>my</i> pyramid. I am putting
up the money for it, and I have got to be mortared
up in it when I die. So I am trying to
make a good, substantial job of it, and letting
the mere beauty of it go hang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, there are plenty of uglier things
in Egypt. Look at some of those fifth-rate
pyramids up the river. When it comes to shape
they are pretty much the same as this one, and
when it comes to size, they look like warts beside
it. And look at the Sphinx. There is
something that cost four millions if it cost a
copper&mdash;and what is it now? A burlesque! A
caricature! An architectural cripple! So long
as it was <i>new</i>, good enough! It was a showy
piece of work. People came all the way from
Sicyonia and Tyre to gape at it. Everybody
said it was one of the sights no one could afford
to miss. But by and by a piece began to
peel off here and another piece there, and then
the nose cracked, and then an ear dropped off,
and then one of the eyes began to get mushy
and watery looking, and finally it was a mere
smudge, a false-face, a scarecrow. My father
spent a lot of money trying to fix it up, but
what good did it do? By the time he had the
nose cobbled the ears were loose again, and
so on. In the end he gave it up as a bad job.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; this pyramid has kept me on the jump,
but I&rsquo;m going to stick to it if it breaks me.
Some say I ought to have built it across the
river, where the quarries are. Such gabble
makes me sick. Do I look like a man who
would go looking around for such <i>child&rsquo;s-play</i>?
I hope not. A one-legged man could have done
<i>that</i>. Even a Babylonian could have done it.
It would have been as easy as milking a cow.
What <i>I</i> wanted was something that would keep
me on the jump&mdash;something that would put a
strain on me. So I decided to haul the whole
business <i>across</i> the river&mdash;six million tons of
rock. And when the engineers said that it
couldn&rsquo;t be done, I gave them two days to get
out of Egypt, and then tackled it myself. It
was something new and hard. It was a job
I could get my teeth into.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you know what a time I
had of it at the start. First I tried a pontoon
bridge, but the stones for the bottom course
were so heavy that they sank the pontoons, and
I lost a couple of hundred niggers before I
saw that it couldn&rsquo;t be done. Then I tried a
big raft, but in order to get her to float with
the stones I had to use such big logs that she
was unwieldy, and before I knew what had
struck me I had lost six big dressed stones and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>another hundred niggers. I got the laugh,
of course. Every numskull in Egypt wagged
his beard over it; I could hear the chatter myself.
But I kept quiet and stuck to the problem,
and by and by I solved it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know how I did it. In a
general way? Well, the details are simple.
First I made a new raft, a good deal lighter
than the old one, and then I got a thousand
water-tight goat-skins and had them blown up
until they were as tight as drums. Then I got
together a thousand niggers who were good
swimmers, and gave each of them one of the
blown-up goat-skins. On each goat-skin there
was a leather thong, and on the bottom of the
raft, spread over it evenly, there were a thousand
hooks. Do you get the idea? Yes; that&rsquo;s
it exactly. The niggers dived overboard with
the goat-skins, swam under the raft, and tied
the thongs to the hooks. And when all of them
were tied on, the raft floated like a bladder.
You simply <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> sink it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally enough, the thing took time, and
there were accidents and setbacks. For instance,
some of the niggers were so light in
weight that they couldn&rsquo;t hold their goat-skins
under water long enough to get them under the
raft. I had to weight those fellows by having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>rocks tied around their middles. And when
they had fastened their goat-skins and tried to
swim back, some of them were carried down
by the rocks. I never made any exact count,
but I suppose that two or three hundred of
them were drowned in that way. Besides, a
couple of hundred were drowned because they
couldn&rsquo;t hold their breaths long enough to swim
under the raft and back. But what of it? I
wasn&rsquo;t trying to hoard up niggers, but to make
a raft that would float. And I did it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, once I showed how it could be done,
all the wiseacres caught the idea, and after that
I put a big gang to work making more rafts,
and by and by I had sixteen of them in operation,
and was hauling more stone than the masons
could set. But I won&rsquo;t go into all that.
Here is the pyramid; it speaks for itself. One
year more and I&rsquo;ll have the top course laid and
begin on the surfacing. I am going to make
it plain marble, with no fancy work. I could
bring in a gang of Theban stonecutters and
have it carved all over with lions&rsquo; heads and
tiger claws and all that sort of gim-crackery,
but why waste time and money? This isn&rsquo;t a
menagerie, but a pyramid. My idea was to
make it the boss pyramid of the world. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>king who tries to beat it will have to get up
pretty early in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what troubles I have had! Believe me,
there has been nothing but trouble, trouble,
trouble from the start. I set aside the engineering
difficulties. They were hard for the
engineers, but easy for me, once I put my mind
on them. But the way these niggers have carried
on has been something terrible. At the
beginning I had only a thousand or two, and
they all came from one tribe; so they got along
fairly well. During the whole first year I
doubt that more than twenty or thirty were
killed in fights. But then I began to get fresh
batches from up the river, and after that it
was nothing but one fight after another. For
two weeks running not a stroke of work was
done. I really thought, at one time, that I&rsquo;d
have to give up. But finally the army put down
the row, and after a couple of hundred of the
ringleaders had been thrown into the river
peace was restored. But it cost me, first and
last, fully three thousand niggers, and set me
back at least six months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then came the so-called labor unions, and
the strikes, and more trouble. These labor
unions were started by a couple of smart, yellow
niggers from Chaldea, one of them a sort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>of lay preacher, a fellow with a lot of gab.
Before I got wind of them, they had gone so
far it was almost impossible to squelch them.
First I tried conciliation, but it didn&rsquo;t work a
bit. They made the craziest demands you ever
heard of&mdash;a holiday every six days, meat every
day, no night work and regular houses to live
in. Some of them even had the effrontery to
ask for money! Think of it! Niggers asking
for money! Finally, I had to order out the
army again and let some blood. But every
time one was knocked over, I had to get another
one to take his place, and that meant
sending the army up the river, and more expense,
and more devilish worry and nuisance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my grandfather&rsquo;s time niggers were honest
and faithful workmen. You could take one
fresh from the bush, teach him to handle a
shovel or pull a rope in a year or so, and after
that he was worth almost as much as he could
eat. But the nigger of to-day isn&rsquo;t worth a
damn. He never does an honest day&rsquo;s work if
he can help it, and he is forever wanting something.
Take these fellows I have now&mdash;mainly
young bucks from around the First Cataract.
Here are niggers who never saw baker&rsquo;s bread
or butcher&rsquo;s meat until my men grabbed them.
They lived there in the bush like so many hyenas.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>They were ten days&rsquo; march from a
lemon. Well, now they get first-class beef
twice a week, good bread and all the fish they
can catch. They don&rsquo;t have to begin work until
broad daylight, and they lay off at dark.
There is hardly one of them that hasn&rsquo;t got a
psaltery, or a harp, or some other musical instrument.
If they want to dress up and make
believe they are Egyptians, I give them clothes.
If one of them is killed on the work, or by a
stray lion, or in a fight, I have him embalmed
by my own embalmers and plant him like a
man. If one of them breaks a leg or loses an
arm or gets too old to work, I turn him loose
without complaining, and he is free to go home
if he wants to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are they contented? Do they show
any gratitude? Not at all. Scarcely a day
passes that I don&rsquo;t hear of some fresh soldiering.
And, what is worse, they have stirred
up some of my own people&mdash;the carpenters,
stone-cutters, gang bosses and so on. Every
now and then my inspectors find some rotten
libel cut on a stone&mdash;something to the effect
that I am overworking them, and knocking
them about, and holding them against their
will, and generally mistreating them. I haven&rsquo;t
the slightest doubt that some of these inscriptions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>have actually gone into the pyramid: it&rsquo;s
impossible to watch every stone. Well, in the
years to come, they will be dug out and read
by strangers, and I will get a black eye. People
will think of Cheops as a heartless old
rapscallion&mdash;<i>me</i>, mind you! Can you beat it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>A large, gloomy hall, with many rows of
uncushioned, uncomfortable seats, designed, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>would seem, by some one misinformed as to
the average width of the normal human pelvis.
A number of busts of celebrated composers,
once white, but now a dirty gray, stand in
niches along the walls. At one end of the
hall there is a bare, uncarpeted stage, with
nothing on it save a grand piano and a chair.
It is raining outside, and, as hundreds of people
come crowding in, the air is laden with the
mingled scents of umbrellas, raincoats, goloshes,
cosmetics, perfumery and wet hair.</i></p>

<p><i>At eight minutes past four,</i> <span class="sc">The Janitor</span>,
<i>after smoothing his hair with his hands and
putting on a pair of detachable cuffs, emerges
from the wings and crosses the stage, his shoes
squeaking hideously at each step. Arriving at
the piano, he opens it with solemn slowness.
The job seems so absurdly trivial, even to so
mean an understanding, that he can&rsquo;t refrain
from glorifying it with a bit of hocus-pocus.
This takes the form of a careful adjustment
of a mysterious something within the instrument.
He reaches in, pauses a moment as if
in doubt, reaches in again, and then permits a
faint smile of conscious sapience and efficiency
to illuminate his face. All of this accomplished,
he tiptoes back to the wings, his shoes again
squeaking.</i></p>

<p>Now all of them people think I&rsquo;m the professor&rsquo;s
tuner. (<i>The thought gives him such
delight that, for the moment, his brain is
numbed. Then he proceeds.</i>) I guess them
tuners make pretty good money. I wish I could
get the hang of the trick. It <i>looks</i> easy. (<i>By
this time he has disappeared in the wings and
the stage is again a desert. Two or three
women, far back in the hall, start a halfhearted
handclapping. It dies out at once.
The noise of rustling programs and shuffling
feet succeeds it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><i>The scene is the brow of the Hungerberg
at Innsbruck. It is the half hour
before sunset, and the whole lovely
valley of the Inn</i>&mdash;still wie die Nacht,
tief wie das Meer&mdash;<i>begins to glow with
mauves and apple greens, apricots and silvery
blues. Along the peaks of the great snowy
mountains which shut it in, as if from the folly
and misery of the world, there are touches of
piercing primary colours&mdash;red, yellow, violet.
Far below, hugging the winding river, lies little
Innsbruck, with its checkerboard parks and
Christmas garden villas. A battalion of Austrian
soldiers, drilling in the Exerzierplatz,
appears as an army of grey ants, now barely
visible. Somewhere to the left, beyond the
broad flank of the Hungerberg, the night train
for Venice labours toward the town.</i></p>

<p><i>It is a superbly beautiful scene, perhaps the
most beautiful in all Europe. It has colour,
dignity, repose. The Alps here come down a
bit and so increase their spell. They are not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the harsh precipices of Switzerland, nor the
too charming stage mountains of the Trentino,
but rotting billows of clouds and snow, the high
flung waves of some titanic but <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed 'striken'.">stricken</ins> ocean.
Now and then comes a faint clank of metal
from the funicular railway, but the tracks themselves
are hidden among the trees of the lower
slopes. The tinkle of an angelus bell (or
maybe it is only a sheep bell) is heard from
afar. A great bird, an eagle or a falcon,
sweeps across the crystal spaces.</i></p>

<p><i>Here where we are is a shelf on the mountainside,
and the hand of man has converted
it into a terrace. To the rear, clinging to the
mountain, is an Alpine</i> gasthaus&mdash;<i>a bit overdone,
perhaps, with its red-framed windows
and elaborate fretwork, but still genuinely of
the Alps. Along the front of the terrace, protecting
sightseers from the sheer drop of a
thousand feet, is a stout wooden rail.</i></p>

<p><i>A man in an American sack suit, with a
bowler hat on his head, lounges against this
rail. His elbows rest upon it, his legs are
crossed in the fashion of a figure four, and
his face is buried in the red book of Herr
Baedeker. It is the volume on Southern Germany,
and he is reading the list of Munich hotels.
Now and then he stops to mark one with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>a pencil, which he wets at his lips each time.
While he is thus engaged, another man comes
ambling along the terrace, apparently from the
direction of the funicular railway station. He,
too, carries a red book. It is Baedeker on
Austria-Hungary. After gaping around him a
bit, this second man approaches the rail near
the other and leans his elbows upon it. Presently
he takes a package of chewing gum from
his coat pocket, selects two pieces, puts them
into his mouth and begins to chew. Then he
spits idly into space, idly but homerically, a
truly stupendous expectoration, a staggering
discharge from the Alps to the first shelf of
the Lombard plain! The first man, startled
by the report, glances up. Their eyes meet and
there is a vague glimmer of recognition.</i></p>

<p>I hear the meals on those English ships are

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what everybody tells me. But, as for

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that English bacon awful stuff to get

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>It certainly is: all meat and gristle. I wonder

<p>I guess he would yell for the police&mdash;or

<p>Did you like the German cooking on the

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Well, I did and I didn&rsquo;t. The chicken &agrave; la

once. I could eat it every day.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you order it?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t on the bill.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Oh, bill be damned! You might have ordered
it anyhow. Make a fuss and you&rsquo;ll get
what you want. These foreigners have to be
bossed around. They&rsquo;re used to it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I guess you&rsquo;re right. There was a fellow
near me who set up a holler about his room
the minute he saw it&mdash;said it was dark and
musty and not fit to pen a hog in&mdash;and they
gave him one twice as large, and the chief
steward bowed and scraped to him, and the
room stewards danced around him as if he was
a duke. And yet I heard later that he was
nothing but a Bismarck herring importer from
Hoboken.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the way to get what you want.
Did you have any nobility on board?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Yes, there was a Hungarian baron in the
automobile business, and two English sirs. The
baron was quite a decent fellow: I had a talk
with him in the smoking room one night. He
didn&rsquo;t put on any airs at all. You would have
thought he was an ordinary man. But the sirs
kept to themselves. All they did the whole
voyage was to write letters, wear their dress
suits and curse the stewards.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>They tell me over here that the best eating
is on the French lines.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Yes, so I hear. But some say, too, that the
Scandinavian lines are best, and then again I
have heard people boosting the Italian lines.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>I guess each one has its points. They say
that you get wine free with meals on the French
boats.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>But I hear it&rsquo;s fourth-rate wine.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t have to drink it.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s so. But, as for me, I can&rsquo;t stand a
Frenchman. I&rsquo;d rather do without the wine
and travel with the Dutch. Paris is dead compared
with Berlin.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>So it is. But those Germans are awful
sharks. The way they charge in Berlin is
enough to make you sick.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>. I have been there. No
longer ago than last Tuesday&mdash;or was it last
Monday?&mdash;I went into one of those big restaurants
on the Unter den Linden and ordered a
small steak, French fried potatoes, a piece of
pie and a cup of coffee&mdash;and what do you think
those thieves charged me for it? Three marks
fifty. That&rsquo;s eighty-seven and a half cents.
Why, a man could have got the same meal at
home for a dollar. These Germans are running
wild. American money has gone to their
heads. They think every American they get
hold of is a millionaire.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>The French are worse. I went into a hotel
in Paris and paid ten francs a day for a room
for myself and wife, and when we left they
charged me one franc forty a day extra for
sweeping it out and making the bed!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s nothing. Here in Innsbruck they
charge you half a krone a day <i>taxes</i>.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>What! You don&rsquo;t say!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Sure thing. And if you don&rsquo;t eat breakfast
in the hotel they charge you a krone for it
anyhow.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, well, what next? But, after all, you
can&rsquo;t blame them. We Americans come over
here and hand them our pocket-books, and we
ought to be glad if we get anything back at all.
The way a man has to tip is something fearful.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it, though! I stayed in Dresden a week,
and when I left there were six grafters lined
up with their claws out. First came the port<i>eer</i>.
Then came&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>How much did you give the port<i>eer</i>?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Five marks.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>You gave him too much. You ought to have
given him about three marks, or, say, two
marks fifty. How much was your hotel bill?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Including everything?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>No, just your bill for your room.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I paid six marks a day.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, that made forty-two marks for the
week. Now the way to figure out how much
the port<i>eer</i> ought to get is easy: a fellow I met
in Baden-Baden showed me how to do it. First,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>you multiply your hotel bill by two, then you
divide it by twenty-seven, and then you knock
off half a mark. Twice forty-two is eighty-four.
Twenty-seven into eighty-four goes
about three times, and half from three leaves
two and a half. See how easy it is?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>It <i>looks</i> easy, anyhow. But you haven&rsquo;t got
much time to do all that figuring.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, let the port<i>eer</i> wait. The longer he
has to wait the more he appreciates you.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>But how about the others?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just as simple. Your chambermaid gets
a quarter of a mark for every day you have
been in the hotel. But if you stay less than
four days she gets a whole mark anyhow. If
there are two in the party she gets half a mark
a day, but no more than three marks in any
one week.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>But suppose there are two chambermaids?
In Dresden there was one on day duty and one
on night duty. I left at six o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, and so they were both on the job.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. They&rsquo;d have been on the job
anyhow, no matter when you left. But it&rsquo;s just
as easy to figure out the tip for two as for one.
All you have to do is to add fifty per cent. and
then divide it into two halves, and give one to
each girl. Or, better still, give it all to one
girl and tell her to give half to her pal. If
there are three chambermaids, as you sometimes
find in the swell hotels, you add another
fifty per cent. and then divide by three. And
so on.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I see. But how about the hall porter and the
floor waiter?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Just as easy. The hall porter gets whatever
the chambermaid gets, plus twenty-five per
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>cent.&mdash;but no more than two marks in any one
week. The floor waiter gets thirty pfennigs a
day straight, but if you stay only one day he
gets half a mark, and if you stay more than
a week he gets two marks flat a week after the
first week. In some hotels the hall porter don&rsquo;t
shine shoes. If he don&rsquo;t he gets just as much
as if he does, but then the actual &ldquo;boots&rdquo; has to
be taken care of. He gets half a mark every
two days. Every time you put out an extra
pair of shoes he gets fifty per cent. more for
that day. If you shine your own shoes, or go
without shining them, the &ldquo;boots&rdquo; gets half his
regular tip, but never less than a mark a week.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Certainly it seems simple enough. I never
knew there was any such system.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>I guess you didn&rsquo;t. Very few do. But it&rsquo;s
just because Americans don&rsquo;t know it that these
foreign blackmailers shake &rsquo;em down. Once
you let the port<i>eer</i> see that you know the ropes,
he&rsquo;ll pass the word on to the others, and you&rsquo;ll
be treated like a native.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I see. But how about the elevator boy? I
gave the elevator boy in Dresden two marks
and he almost fell on my neck, so I figured that
I played the sucker.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>So you did. The rule for elevator boys is
still somewhat in the air, because so few of
these bum hotels over here have elevators, but
you can sort of reason the thing out if you put
your mind on it. When you get on a street car
in Germany, what tip do you give the conductor?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Five pfennigs.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man.</p>

<p>Naturally. That&rsquo;s the tip fixed by custom.
You may almost say it&rsquo;s the unwritten law. If
you gave the conductor more, he would hand
you change. Well, how I reason it out is this
way: If five pfennigs is enough for a car conductor,
who may carry you three miles, why
shouldn&rsquo;t it be enough for the elevator boy, who
may carry you only three stories?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>It seems fair, certainly.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>And it <i>is</i> fair. So all you have to do is to
keep account of the number of times you go
up and down in the elevator, and then give the
elevator boy five pfennigs for each trip. Say
you come down in the morning, go up in the
evening, and average one other round trip a
day. That makes twenty-eight trips a week.
Five times twenty-eight is one mark forty&mdash;and
there you are.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I see. By the way, what hotel are you stopping
at?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>The Goldene Esel.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>How is it?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Oh, so-so. Ask for oatmeal at breakfast
and they send to the livery stable for a peck
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>of oats and ask you please to be so kind as
to show them how to make it.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>My hotel is even worse. Last night I got
into such a sweat under the big German feather
bed that I had to throw it off. But when I
asked for a single blanket they didn&rsquo;t have any,
so I had to wrap up in bath towels.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Yes, and you used up every one in town.
This morning, when I took a bath, the only
towel the chambermaid could find wasn&rsquo;t bigger
than a wedding invitation. But while she
was hunting around I dried off, so no harm
was done.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what a man gets for running
around in such one-horse countries. In Leipzig
they sat a nigger down beside me at the table.
In Amsterdam they had cheese for breakfast.
In Munich the head waiter had never heard of
buckwheat cakes. In Mannheim they charged
me ten pfennigs extra for a cake of soap.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>What do you think of the railroad trains
over here?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Rotten. That compartment system is all
wrong. If nobody comes into your compartment
it&rsquo;s lonesome, and if anybody <i>does</i> come
in it&rsquo;s too damn sociable. And if you try to
stretch out and get some sleep, some ruffian
begins singing in the next compartment, or the
conductor keeps butting in and jabbering at you.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>But you can say <i>one</i> thing for the German
trains: they get in on time.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>So they do, but no wonder! They run so
slow they can&rsquo;t <i>help</i> it. The way I figure it, a
German engineer must have a devil of a time
holding his engine in. The fact is, he usually
can&rsquo;t, and so he has to wait outside every big
town until the schedule catches up to him. They
say they never have accidents, but is it any more
than you expect? Did you ever hear of a mud
turtle having an accident?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Scarcely. As you say, these countries are far
behind the times. I saw a fire in Cologne; you
would have laughed your head off! It was
in a feed store near my hotel, and I got there
before the firemen. When they came at last,
in their tinpot hats, they got out half a dozen
big squirts and rushed into the building with
them. Then, when it was out, they put the
squirts back into their little express wagon and
drove off. Not a line of hose run out, not an
engine puffing, not a gong heard, not a soul
letting out a whoop! It was more like a Sunday-school
picnic than a fire. I guess if these
Dutch ever <i>did</i> have a civilised blaze, it would
scare them to death. But they never have any.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Well, what can you expect? A country
where all the charwomen are men and all the
garbage men are women!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>For the moment the two have talked each
other out, and so they lounge upon the rail in
silence and gaze out over the valley. Anon the
gumchewer spits. By now the sun has reached
the skyline to the westward and the tops of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>ice mountains are in gorgeous conflagration.
Scarlets war with golden oranges, and vermilions
fade into palpitating pinks. Below, in the
valley, the colours begin to fade slowly to a
uniform seashell grey. It is a scene of indescribable
loveliness; the wild reds of hades
splashed riotously upon the cold whites and pale
blues of heaven. The night train for Venice, a
long line of black coaches, is entering the town.
Somewhere below, apparently in the barracks,
a sunset gun is fired. After a silence of perhaps
two or three minutes, the Americans
gather fresh inspiration and resume their conversation.</i></p>

<p>I have seen worse scenery.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Very pretty.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Yes, sir; it&rsquo;s well worth the money.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>But the Rockies beat it all hollow.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Oh, of course. They have nothing over
here that we can&rsquo;t beat to a whisper. Just consider
the Rhine, for instance. The Hudson
makes it look like a country creek.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Take away the castles,
and not even a German would give a hoot for
it. It&rsquo;s not so much what a thing <i>is</i> over here
as what <i>reputation</i> it&rsquo;s got. The whole thing
is a matter of press-agenting.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>I agree with you. There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;beautiful,
blue Danube.&rdquo; To me it looks like a sewer. If
<i>it&rsquo;s</i> blue, then <i>I&rsquo;m</i> green. A man would hesitate
to drown himself in such a mud puddle.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>But you hear the bands playing that waltz
all your life, and so you spend your good money
to come over here to see the river. And when
you get back home you don&rsquo;t want to admit
that you&rsquo;ve been a sucker, so you start touting
it from hell to breakfast. And then some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>other fellow comes over and does the same,
and so on and so on.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s all a matter of boosting. Day in
and day out you hear about Westminster Abbey.
Every English book mentions it; it&rsquo;s in
the newspapers almost as much as Jane Addams
or Caruso. Well, one day you pack your
grip, put on your hat and come over to have a
look&mdash;and what do you find? A one-horse
church full of statues! And every statue crying
for sapolio! You expect to see something
magnificent and enormous, something to knock
your eye out and send you down for the count.
What you do see is a second-rate graveyard
under roof. And when you examine into it,
you find that two-thirds of the graves haven&rsquo;t
even got dead men in them! Whenever a
prominent Englishman dies, they put up a
statue to him in Westminster Abbey&mdash;<i>no matter
where he happens to be buried</i>! I call
that clever advertising. That&rsquo;s the way to get
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Yes, these foreigners know the game. They
have made millions out of it in Paris. Every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>time you go to see a musical comedy at home,
the second act is laid in Paris, and you see a
whole stageful of girls wriggling around, and
a lot of old sports having the time of their
lives. All your life you hear that Paris is
something rich and racy, something that makes
New York look like Roanoke, Virginia. Well,
you fall for the ballyho and come over to have
your fling&mdash;and then you find that Paris is
largely bunk. I spent a whole week in Paris,
trying to find something really awful. I hired
one of those Jew guides at five dollars a day
and told him to go the limit. I said to him:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind <i>me</i>. I am twenty-one years old.
Let me have the genuine goods.&rdquo; But the
worst he could show me wasn&rsquo;t half as bad as
what I have seen in Chicago. Every night I
would say to that Jew: &ldquo;Come on, now Mr.
Cohen; let&rsquo;s get away from these tinhorn shows.
Lead me to the real stuff.&rdquo; Well, I believe the
fellow did his darndest, but he always fell down.
I almost felt sorry for him. In the end, when
I paid him off, I said to him: &ldquo;Save up your
money, my boy, and come over to the States.
Let me know when you land. I&rsquo;ll show you the
sights for nothing. This Baracca Class atmosphere
is killing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>And yet Paris is famous all over the world.
No American ever came to Europe without
dropping off there to have a look. I once saw
the Bal Tabarin crowded with Sunday-school
superintendents returning from Jerusalem.
And when the sucker gets home he goes around
winking and hinting, and so the fake grows.
I often think the government ought to take a
hand. If the beer is inspected and guaranteed
in Germany, why shouldn&rsquo;t the shows be inspected
and guaranteed in Paris?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I guess the trouble is that the Frenchmen
themselves never go to their own shows. They
don&rsquo;t know what is going on. They see thousands
of Americans starting out every night
from the Place de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra and coming back
in the morning all boozed up, and so they assume
that everything is up to the mark. You&rsquo;ll
find the same thing in Washington. No Washingtonian
has ever been up to the top of the
Washington monument. Once the elevator in
the monument was out of commission for two
weeks, and yet Washington knew nothing about
it. When the news got into the papers at last,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>it came from Macon, Georgia. Some honeymooner
from down there had written home
about it, roasting the government.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, me for the good old U. S. A.! These
Alps are all right, I guess&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t say I
like the coffee.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>And it takes too long to get a letter from
Jersey City.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Yes, that reminds me. Just before I started
up here this afternoon my wife got the <i>Ladies&rsquo;
Home Journal</i> of the month before last. It
had been following us around for six weeks,
from London to Paris, to Berlin, to Munich, to
Vienna, to a dozen other places. Now she&rsquo;s
fixed for the night. She won&rsquo;t let up until she&rsquo;s
read every word&mdash;the advertisements first.
And she&rsquo;ll spend all day to-morrow sending
off for things; new collar hooks, breakfast
foods, complexion soaps and all that sort of
junk. Are you married yourself?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>No; not yet.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, then, you don&rsquo;t know how it is. But
I guess you play poker.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>Oh, to be sure.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go down into the town and hunt
up some quiet barroom and have a civilised
evening. This scenery gives me the creeps.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Second Man</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you. But where are we going to
get any chips?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The First Man</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. I carry a set with me. I made
my wife put it in the bottom of my trunk, along
with a bottle of real whiskey and a couple of
porous plasters. A man can&rsquo;t be too careful
when he&rsquo;s away from home&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p><i>They start along the terrace toward the station
of the funicular railway. The sun has
now disappeared behind the great barrier of
ice and the colours of the scene are fast softening.
All the scarlets and vermilions are gone;
a luminous pink bathes the whole picture in its
fairy light. The night train for Venice, leaving
the town, appears as a long string of blinking
lights. A chill breeze comes from the Alpine
vastness to westward. The deep silence of an
Alpine night settles down. The two Americans
continue their talk until they are out of hearing.
The breeze interrupts and obfuscates their
words, but now and then half a sentence comes
clearly.</i></p>

<p class='noin'>And yet, and yet&mdash;is not all this contumely
a part of my punishment? To
be reviled by the righteous as the author
of all evil; worse still, to be venerated
by the wicked as the accomplice, nay, the
instigator, of their sins! A harsh, hard fate!
But should I not rejoice that I have been vouchsafed
the strength to bear it, that the ultimate
mercy is mine? Should I not be full of calm,
deep delight that I am blessed with the resignation
of the Psalmist (II Samuel XV, 26), the
sublime grace of the pious Hezekiah (II Kings
XX, 19)? If Hezekiah could bear the cruel
visitation of his erring upon his sons, why
should I, poor worm that I am, repine?</p>

<p class='date'>January 8.</p>

<p>All afternoon I watched the damned filing
in. With what horror that spectacle must fill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>every right-thinking man! Sometimes I think
that the worst of all penalties of sin is this:
that the sinful actually seem to be glad of their
sins (Psalms X, 4). I looked long and earnestly
into that endless procession of faces. In
not one of them did I see any sign of sorrow
or repentance. They marched in defiantly,
almost proudly. Ever and anon I heard a
snicker, sometimes a downright laugh: there
was a coarse buffoonery in the ranks. I turned
aside at last, unable to bear it longer. Here
they will learn what their laughter is worth!
(Eccl. II, 2.)</p>

<p>Among them I marked a female, young and
fair. How true the words of Solomon:
&ldquo;Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain!&rdquo;
(Proverbs XXXI, 30.) I could not bring
myself to put down upon these pages the whole
record of that wicked creature&rsquo;s shameless life.
Truly it has been said that &ldquo;the lips of a strange
woman drop as a honeycomb, and her mouth is
smoother than oil.&rdquo; (Proverbs V, 3.) One
hears of such careers of evil-doing and can
scarcely credit them. Can it be that the children
of men are so deaf to all the warnings given
them, so blind to the vast certainty of their
punishment, so ardent in seeking temptation,
so lacking in holy fire to resist it? Such thoughts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>fill me with the utmost distress. Is not the command
to a moral life plain enough? Are we
not told to &ldquo;live soberly, righteously, and
godly?&rdquo; (Titus II, 11.) Are we not solemnly
warned to avoid the invitation of evil? (Proverbs
I, 10.)</p>

<p class='date'>January 9.</p>

<p>I have had that strange woman before me
and heard her miserable story. It is as I
thought. The child of a poor but pious mother,
(a widow with six children), she had every advantage
of a virtuous, consecrated home. The
mother, earning $6 a week, gave 25 cents of
it to foreign missions. The daughter, at the
tender age of 4, was already a regular attendant
at Sabbath-school. The good people of
the church took a Christian interest in the family,
and one of them, a gentleman of considerable
wealth, and an earnest, diligent worker for
righteousness, made it his special care to befriend
the girl. He took her into his office,
treating her almost as one of his own daughters.
She served him in the capacity of stenographer,
receiving therefor the wage of $7.00 a week,
a godsend to that lowly household. How truly,
indeed, it has been said: &ldquo;Verily, there is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>reward for the righteous.&rdquo; (Psalms LVIII,
11.)</p>

<p>And now behold how powerful are the
snares of evil. (Genesis VI, 12.) There was
that devout and saintly man, ripe in good works,
a deacon and pillar in the church, a steadfast
friend to the needy and erring, a stalwart supporter
of his pastor in all forward-looking enterprises,
a tower of strength for righteousness
in his community, the father of four daughters.
And there was that shameless creature, that
evil woman, that sinister temptress. With the
noisome details I do not concern myself. Suffice
it to say that the vile arts of the hussy prevailed
over that noble and upright man&mdash;that
she enticed him, by adroit appeals to his sympathy,
into taking her upon automobile rides,
into dining with her clandestinely in the private
rooms of dubious hotels, and finally into accompanying
her upon a despicable, adulterous
visit to Atlantic City. And then, seeking to
throw upon him the blame for what she chose
to call her &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; she held him up to public
disgrace and worked her own inexorable damnation
by taking her miserable life. Well hath
the Preacher warned us against the woman
whose &ldquo;heart is snares and nets, and her hands
as bands.&rdquo; (Eccl. VII, 26.) Well do we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>know the wreck and ruin that such agents of
destruction can work upon the innocent and
trusting. (Revelations XXI, 8; I Corinthians
VI, 18; Job XXXI, 12; Hosea IV, 11: Proverbs
VI, 26.)</p>

<p class='date'>January 11.</p>

<p>We have resumed our evening services&mdash;an
hour of quiet communion in the failing light.
The attendance, alas, is not as gratifying as it
might be, but the brethren who gather are
filled with holy zeal. It is inspiring to hear
their eloquent confessions of guilt and wrongdoing,
their trembling protestations of contrition.
Several of them are of long experience
and considerable proficiency in public speaking.
One was formerly a major in the Salvation
Army. Another spent twenty years in the
Dunkard ministry, finally retiring to devote
himself to lecturing on the New Thought. A
third was a Y. M. C. A. secretary in Iowa. A
fourth was the first man to lift his voice for
sex hygiene west of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>All these men eventually succumbed to temptation,
and hence they are here, but I think
that no one who has ever glimpsed their secret
and inmost souls (as I have during our hours
of humble heart-searching together) will fail
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>to testify to their inherent purity of character.
After all, it is not what we do but what we have
in our hearts that reveals our true worth.
(Joshua XXIV, 14.) As David so beautifully
puts it, it is &ldquo;the imagination of the
thoughts.&rdquo; (I Chronicles XXIII, 9.) I love
and trust these brethren. They are true and
earnest Christians. They loathe the temptation
to which they succumbed, and deplore the
weakness that made them yield. How the
memory at once turns to that lovely passage in
the Book of Job: &ldquo;Wherefore I abhor myself,
and repent in dust and ashes.&rdquo; Where is
there a more exquisite thought in all Holy
Writ?</p>

<p class='date'>January 14.</p>

<p>I have had that scarlet woman before me,
and invited her to join us in our inspiring evening
gatherings. For reply she mocked me.
Thus Paul was mocked by the Athenians. Thus
the children of Bethel mocked Elisha the
Prophet (II Kings II, 23). Thus the sinful
show their contempt, not only for righteousness
itself, but also for its humblest agents and advocates.
Nevertheless, I held my temper before
her. I indulged in no vain and worldly
recriminations. When she launched into her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>profane and disgraceful tirade against that
good and faithful brother, her benefactor and
victim, I held my peace. When she accused
him of foully destroying her, I returned her no
harsh words. Instead, I merely read aloud to
her those inspiring words from Revelation XIV,
10: &ldquo;And the evil-doer shall be tormented with
fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy
angels.&rdquo; And then I smiled upon her and bade
her begone. Who am I, that I should hold
myself above the most miserable of sinners?</p>

<p class='date'>January 18.</p>

<p>Again that immoral woman. I had sent her
a few Presbyterian tracts: &ldquo;The Way to Redemption,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Story of a Missionary in
Polynesia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The White Slave,&rdquo;&mdash;inspiring
and consecrated writings, all of them&mdash;comforting
to me in many a bitter hour. When she
came in I thought it was to ask me to pray with
her. (II Chronicles VII, 14.) But her heart,
it appears, is still shut to the words of salvation.
She renewed her unseemly denunciation of her
benefactor, and sought to overcome me with
her weeping. I found myself strangely drawn
toward her&mdash;almost pitying her. She approached
me, her eyes suffused with tears, her
red lips parted, her hair flowing about her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>shoulders. I felt myself drawn to her. I knew
and understood the temptation of that great
and good man. But by a powerful effort of the
will&mdash;or, should I say, by a sudden access of
grace?&mdash;I recovered and pushed her from me.
And then, closing my eyes to shut out the image
of her, I pronounced those solemn and awful
words: &ldquo;Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!&rdquo;
The effect was immediate: she emitted a moan
and departed. I had resisted her abhorrent
blandishments. (Proverbs I, 10.)</p>

<p class='date'>January 25.</p>

<p>I love the Book of Job. Where else in the
Scriptures is there a more striking picture of
the fate that overtakes those who yield to sin?
&ldquo;They meet with darkness in the day-time, and
grope in the noon-day as in the night&rdquo; (Job V,
14). And further on: &ldquo;They grope in the
dark without light, and he maketh them to
stagger like a drunken man&rdquo; (Job XII, 25). I
read these beautiful passages over and over
again. They comfort me.</p>

<p class='date'>January 28.</p>

<p>That shameless person once more. She
sends back the tracts I gave her&mdash;torn in
halves.</p>

<p class='date'>February 3.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>That American brother, the former Dunkard,
thrilled us with his eloquence at to-night&rsquo;s
meeting. In all my days I have heard no more
affecting plea for right living. In words that
almost seemed to be of fire he set forth the
duty of all of us to combat sin wherever we
find it, and to scourge the sinner until he foregoes
his folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not sufficient,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we keep
our own hearts pure: we must also purge the
heart of our brother. And if he resist us, let
no false sympathy for him stay our hands. We
are charged with the care and oversight of his
soul. He is in our keeping. Let us seek at
first to save him with gentleness, but if he
draws back, let us unsheath the sword! We
must be deaf to his protests. We must not be
deceived by his casuistries. If he clings to his
sinning, he must perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cries of &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; arose spontaneously from
the little band of consecrated workers. I have
never heard a more triumphant call to that
Service which is the very heart&rsquo;s blood of righteousness.
Who could listen to it, and then
stay his hand?</p>

<p>I looked for that scarlet creature. She was
not there.</p>

<p class='date'>February 7.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen her again. She came, I thought,
in all humility. I received her gently, quoting
aloud the beautiful words of Paul in Colossians
III, 12: &ldquo;Put on therefore, holy and beloved,
bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of
mind, meekness, long-suffering.&rdquo; And then I
addressed her in calm, encouraging tones:
&ldquo;Are you ready, woman, to put away your
evil-doing, and forswear your carnalities forevermore?
Have you repented of your black
and terrible sin? Do you ask for mercy?
Have you come in sackcloth and ashes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect, alas, was not what I planned.
Instead of yielding to my entreaty and casting
herself down for forgiveness, she yielded to her
pride and mocked me! And then, her heart
still full of the evils of the flesh, <i>she tried to
tempt me</i>! She approached me. She lifted up
her face to mine. She smiled at me with abominable
suggestiveness. She touched me with
her garment. She laid her hand upon my arm....
I felt my resolution going from me. I
was as one stricken with the palsy. My tongue
clave to the roof of my mouth. My hands
trembled. I tried to push her from me and
could not....</p>

<p class='date'>February 10.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In all humility of spirit I set it down. The
words burn the paper; the fact haunts me like
an evil dream. I yielded to that soulless and
abominable creature. I <i>kissed her</i>.... And
then she laughed, making a mock of me in my
weakness, burning me with the hot iron of her
scorn, piercing my heart with the daggers of
her reviling. Laughed, and slapped my face!
Laughed, and spat in my eye! Laughed, <i>and
called me a hypocrite</i>!...</p>

<p>They have taken her away. <i>Let her taste the
fire!</i> Let her sin receive its meet and inexorable
punishment! Let righteousness prevail!
Let her go with &ldquo;the fearful and unbelieving,
the abominable and murderers, the white-slave
traders and sorcerers.&rdquo; Off with her to that
lake &ldquo;which burneth with fire and brimstone!&rdquo;
(Revelation XXI, 8.)....</p>

<p>Go, Jezebel! Go, Athaliah! Go, Painted
One! Thy sins have found thee out.</p>

<p class='date'>February 11.</p>

<p>I spoke myself at to-night&rsquo;s meeting&mdash;simple
words, but I think their message was not lost.
We must wage forever the good fight. We
must rout the army of sin from its fortresses....</p>

leap-tick; and from the saxophone, the piccolo,
the cornet and the bagpipes; and from the

from all symphonic poems by English composers;

bad dinners and poison the air with Tosti&rsquo;s
<i>Good-bye</i>; and from the low prehensile, godless

saving of tenors who are happily threatened
with loss of voice; and from clarinet cadenzas

first two acts of <i>Il Trovatore</i>; and from such
fluffy, xanthous whiskers as Lohengrins wear;

cigars whenever they think of old Josef
Haydn&mdash;good Lord, deliver us!</p>

<h3><i>IV.&mdash;For Hangmen</i></h3>

<p>From clients who delay the exercises by
pausing to make long and irrelevant speeches
from the scaffold, or to sing depressing Methodist
hymns; and from medical examiners who
forget their stethoscopes, and clamor for waits
while messenger boys are sent for them; and
from official witnesses who faint at the last
minute, and have to be hauled out by the deputy
sheriffs; and from undertakers who keep looking
at their watches and hinting obscenely that
they have other engagements at 10:30; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>from spiritual advisers who crowd up at the
last minute and fall through the trap with the
condemned&mdash;good Lord, deliver us!</p>

<h3><i>V.&mdash;For Magazine Editors</i></h3>

<p>From Old Subscribers who write in to say
that the current number is the worst magazine
printed since the days of the New York <i>Galaxy</i>;

the popular text-books of sex hygiene, and believe
all the bosh in them about the white slave
trade, and so suspect the editor, and even the
publisher, of sinister designs; and from stories

the dead wood upon a burly political boss
named Terrence O&rsquo;Flaherty, and then falls
in love with Mignon, his daughter, and has to
let him go; and from stories in which a married
lady, just about to sail for Capri with her husband&rsquo;s
old <i>Corpsbruder</i>, is dissuaded from her
purpose by the news that her husband has lost
$700,000 in Wall Street and is on his way home
to weep on her shoulder; and from one-act
plays in which young Cornelius Van Suydam
comes home from The Club at 11:55 P. M.
on Christmas Eve, dismisses Dodson, his Man,
with the compliments of the season, and draws
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>up his chair before the open fire to dream of
his girl, thus preparing the way for the entrance
of Maxwell, the starving burglar, and for the
scene in which Maxwell&rsquo;s little daughter, Fifi,
following him up the fire-escape, pleads with
him to give up his evil courses; and from poems
about war in which it is argued that thousands
of young men are always killed, and that their
mothers regret to hear of it; and from essays
of a sweet and whimsical character, in which
the author refers to himself as &ldquo;we,&rdquo; and ends
by quoting Bergson, Washington Irving or
Agnes Repplier; and from epigrams based on
puns, good or bad; and from stories beginning,
&ldquo;It was the autumn of the year 1950&rdquo;;
and from stories embodying quotations from
Omar Khayyam, and full of a mellow pessimism;
and from stories in which the gay nocturnal
life of the Latin Quarter is described by
an author living in Dubuque, Iowa; and from
stories of thought transference, mental healing
and haunted houses; and from newspaper
stories in which a cub reporter solves the mystery
of the Snodgrass murder and is promoted
to dramatic critic on the field, or in which a city
editor who smokes a corn-cob pipe falls in love
with a sob-sister; and from stories about trained
nurses, young dramatists, baseball players,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>heroic locomotive engineers, settlement workers,
clergymen, yeggmen, cowboys, Italians,
employ&eacute;s of the Hudson Bay Company and
great detectives; and from stories in which the
dissolute son of a department store owner tries
to seduce a working girl in his father&rsquo;s employ
and then goes on the water wagon and marries
her as a tribute to her virtue; and from stories
in which the members of a yachting party are
wrecked on a desert island in the South Pacific,
and the niece of the owner of the yacht falls
in love with the bo&rsquo;sun; and from manuscripts
accompanied by documents certifying that the
incidents and people described are real, though
cleverly disguised; and from authors who send
in saucy notes when their offerings are returned
with insincere thanks; and from lady authors
who appear with satirical letters of introduction
from the low, raffish rogues who edit rival
magazines&mdash;good Lord, deliver us!</p>

<p class="c"><span class='sc'>Time</span>&mdash;<i>Noon of a fair day.</i></p>

<p><i>Seats rising in curved tiers. The operating
pit paved with white tiles. The usual operating
table has been pushed to one side, and in place
of it there is a small glass-topped bedside table.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>On it, a large roll of aseptic cotton, several pads
of gauze, a basin of bichloride, a pair of clinical
thermometers in a little glass of alcohol,
a dish of green soap, a beaker of two per cent.
carbolic acid, and a microscope. In one corner
stands a sterilizer, steaming pleasantly like a
tea kettle. There are no decorations&mdash;no flowers,
no white ribbons, no satin cushions. To
the left a door leads into the Anesthetic Room.
A pungent smell of ether, nitrous oxide, iodine,
chlorine, wet laundry and scorched gauze.
Temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahr.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">The Clergyman</span> <i>is discovered standing behind
the table in an expectant attitude. He is
in the long white coat of a surgeon, with his
head wrapped in white gauze and a gauze
respirator over his mouth. His chunkiness suggests
a fat, middle-aged Episcopal rector, but
it is impossible to see either his face or his vestments.
He wears rubber gloves of a dirty
orange color, evidently much used.</i> <span class="sc">The
Bridegroom</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">The Best Man</span> <i>have just
emerged from the Anesthetic Room and are
standing before him. Both are dressed exactly
as he is, save that</i> <span class="sc">The Bridegroom&rsquo;s</span> <i>rubber
gloves are white. The benches running up the
amphitheatre are filled with spectators, chiefly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>women. They are in dingy oilskins, and most
of them also wear respirators.</i></p>

<p><i>After a long and uneasy pause</i> <span class="sc">The Bride</span>
<i>comes in from the Anesthetic Room on the arm
of her</i> <span class="sc">Father</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="sc">the Four Bridesmaids</span>
<i>following by twos. She is dressed in what appears
to be white linen, with a long veil of
aseptic gauze. The gauze testifies to its late
and careful sterilization by yellowish scorches.
There is a white rubber glove upon</i> <span class="sc">the Bride&rsquo;s</span>
<i>right hand, but that belonging to her left hand
has been removed</i>. <span class="sc">Her Father</span> <i>is dressed
like</i> <span class="sc">the Best Man</span>. <span class="sc">The Four Bridesmaids</span>
<i>are in the garb of surgical nurses, with their
hair completely concealed by turbans of gauze.
As</i> <span class="sc">the Bride</span> <i>takes her place before</i> <span class="sc">the
Clergyman</span>, <i>with</i> <span class="sc">the Bridegroom</span> <i>at her
right, there is a faint, snuffling murmur among
the spectators. It hushes suddenly as</i> <span class="sc">the
Clergyman</span> <i>clears his throat</i>.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>(<i>In sonorous, booming tones, somewhat muffled
by his respirator.</i>) Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here together in the face of this
company to join together this man and this
woman in holy matrimony, which is commended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>by God to be honorable among men, and therefore
is not to be entered into inadvisedly or
carelessly, or without due surgical precautions,
but reverently, cleanly, sterilely, soberly, scientifically,
and with the nearest practicable approach
to bacteriological purity. Into this laudable
and non-infectious state these two persons
present come now to be joined and quarantined.
If any man can show just cause, either clinically
or microscopically, why they may not be safely
sutured together, let him now come forward
with his charts, slides and cultures, or else hereafter
forever hold his peace.</p>

<p>(<i>Several spectators shuffle their feet, and an
old maid giggles, but no one comes forward.</i>)</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">the Bride</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Bridegroom</span>): I require
and charge both of you, as ye will answer
in the dreadful hour of autopsy, when the
secrets of all lives shall be disclosed, that if
either of you know of any lesion, infection, malaise,
congenital defect, hereditary taint or other
impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined
together in eugenic matrimony, ye do now confess
it. For be ye well assured that if any
persons are joined together otherwise than in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>a state of absolute chemical and bacteriological
innocence, their marriage will be septic, unhygienic,
pathogenic and toxic, and eugenically
null and void.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>(<i>The reading finished</i>) Very good. Very
creditable. You must see some good oculist
about your astigmatism, my dear. Surely you
want to avoid glasses. Come to my study on
your return and I&rsquo;ll give you the name of a
trustworthy man. And now let us proceed with
the ceremony of marriage. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">The Bridegroom</span>):
John, wilt thou have this woman to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>be thy wedded wife, to live together in the holy
state of eugenic matrimony? Wilt thou love
her, comfort her, protect her from all protozoa
and bacteria, and keep her in good health; and,
forsaking all other, keep thee unto her only, so
long as ye both shall live? If so, hold out your
tongue.</p>

<p>(<span class="sc">The Bridegroom</span> <i>holds out his tongue and</i>
<span class="sc">The Clergyman</span> <i>inspects it critically.</i>)</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>(<i>Somewhat dubiously</i>) Fair. I have seen
worse.... Do you smoke?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Bridegroom</p>

<p>(<i>Obviously lying</i>) Not much.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>Well, <i>how</i> much?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Bridegroom</p>

<p>Say ten cigarettes a day.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>And the stain noted on your right posterior

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Bridegroom</p>

<p>Well, say fifteen.</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>(<i>Waggishly</i>) Or twenty to be safe. Better
taper off to ten. At all events, make twenty
the limit. How about the booze?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Bridegroom</p>

<p>(<i>Virtuously</i>) Never!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

<p>What! Never?</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Bridegroom</p>

<p>Well, never again!</p>

<p class='c mt2 noin sc'>The Clergyman</p>

of the liturgy. But have a care, my dear fellow!

Pathological</i></h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<h3><i>I.&mdash;The Rewards of Science</i></h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a surgeon
who spent seven years perfecting an
extraordinarily delicate and laborious
operation for the cure of a rare and
deadly disease. In the process he wore
out $400 worth of knives and saws and
used up $6,000 worth of ether, splints, guinea
pigs, homeless dogs and bichloride of mercury.
His board and lodging during the seven years
came to $2,875. Finally he got a patient and
performed the operation. It took eight hours
and cost him $17 more than his fee of $20....</p>

<p>One day, two months after the patient was
discharged as cured, the surgeon stopped in his
rambles to observe a street parade. It was the
annual turnout of Good Hope Lodge, No. 72,
of the Patriotic Order of American Rosicrucians.
The cured patient, marching as Supreme
Worthy Archon, wore a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: The original showed 'lavendar'.">lavender</ins> baldric, a pea-green
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>sash, an aluminum helmet and scarlet
gauntlets, and carried an ormolu sword and
the blue polka-dot flag of a rear-admiral....</p>

<p>With a low cry the surgeon jumped down a
sewer and was seen no more.</p>

<h3><i>II.&mdash;The Incomparable Physician</i></h3>

<p>The eminent physician, Yen Li-Shen, being
called in the middle of the night to the bedside
of the rich tax-gatherer, Chu Yi-Foy, found his
distinguished patient suffering from a spasm of
the liver. An examination of the pulse, tongue,
toe-nails, and hair-roots revealing the fact that
the malady was caused by the presence of a multitude
of small worms in the blood, the learned
doctor forthwith dispatched his servant to his
surgery for a vial of gnats&rsquo; eyes dissolved in
the saliva of men executed by strangling, that
being the remedy advised by Li Tan-Kien and
other high authorities for the relief of this painful
and dangerous condition.</p>

<p>When the servant returned the patient was
so far gone that Cheyne-Stokes breathing had
already set in, and so the doctor decided to administer
the whole contents of the vial&mdash;an
heroic dose, truly, for it has been immemorially
held that even so little as the amount that will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>cling to the end of a horse hair is sufficient to
cure. Alas, in his professional zeal and excitement,
the celebrated pathologist permitted his
hand to shake like a myrtle leaf in a Spring
gale, and so he dropped not only the contents
of the vial, but also the vial itself down the
&oelig;sophagus of his moribund patient.</p>

<p>The accident, however, did not impede the
powerful effects of this famous remedy. In ten
minutes Chu Yi-Foy was so far recovered that
he asked for a plate of rice stewed with plums,
and by morning he was able to leave his bed
and receive the reports of his spies, informers
and extortioners. That day he sent for Dr.
Yen and in token of his gratitude, for he was
a just and righteous man, settled upon him in
due form of law, and upon his heirs and assigns
in perpetuity, the whole rents, rates, imposts
and taxes, amounting to no less than ten thousand
Hangkow taels a year, of two of the
streets occupied by money-changers, bird-cage
makers and public women in the town of Szu-Loon,
and of the related alleys, courts and lanes.
And Dr. Yen, with his old age and the old age
of his seven sons and thirty-one grandsons now
safely provided for, retired from the practise of
his art, and devoted himself to a tedious scientific
inquiry (long the object of his passionate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>aspiration) into the precise physiological relation
between gravel in the lower lobe of the
heart and the bursting of arteries in the arms
and legs.</p>

<p>So passed many years, while Dr. Yen pursued
his researches and sent his annual reports of
progress to the Academy of Medicine at Chan-Si,
and Chu Yi-Foy increased his riches and his
influence, so that his arm reached out from the
mountains to the sea. One day, in his eightieth
year, Chu Yi-Foy fell ill again, and, having no
confidence in any other physician, sent once
more for the learned and now venerable Dr.
Yen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a pain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in my left hip,
where the stomach dips down over the spleen.
A large knob has formed there. A lizard, perhaps,
has got into me. Or perhaps a small
hedge-hog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Yen thereupon made use of the test for
lizards and hedge-hogs&mdash;to wit, the application
of madder dye to the Adam&rsquo;s apple, turning it
lemon yellow if any sort of reptile is within, and
violet if there is a mammal&mdash;but it failed to
operate as the books describe. Being thus led
to suspect a misplaced and wild-growing bone,
perhaps from the vertebral column, the doctor
decided to have recourse to surgery, and so,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>after the proper propitiation of the gods, he
administered to his eminent patient a draught of
opium water, and having excluded the wailing
women of the household from the sick chamber,
he cut into the protuberance with a small, sharp
knife, and soon had the mysterious object in
his hand.... It was the vial of dissolved
gnats&rsquo; eyes&mdash;<i>still full and tightly corked</i>!
Worse, it was <i>not</i> the vial of dissolved gnats&rsquo;
eyes, but a vial of common burdock juice&mdash;the
remedy <i>for infants griped by their mothers&rsquo;
milk</i>....</p>

<p>But when the eminent Chu Yi-Foy, emerging
from his benign stupor, made a sign that he
would gaze upon the cause of his distress, it
was a bone that Dr. Yen Li-Shen showed him&mdash;an
authentic bone, ovoid and evil-looking&mdash;and
lately the knee cap of one Ho Kwang, brass
maker in the street of Szchen-Kiang. Dr. Yen
carried this bone in his girdle to keep off the
black, blue and yellow plagues. Chu Yi-Foy,
looking upon it, wept the soft, grateful tears of
an old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is twice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you, my
learned friend, have saved my life. I have hitherto
given you, in token of my gratitude, the
rents, rates, imposts and taxes, of two streets,
and of the related alleys, courts and lanes. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>now give you the weight of that bone in diamonds,
in rubies, in pearls or in emeralds, as
you will. And whichever of the four you
choose, I give you the other three also. For
is it not said by K&rsquo;ung Fu-tsze, &lsquo;The good physician
bestows what the gods merely promise&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dr. Yen Li-Shen lowered his eyes and
bowed. But he was too old in the healing art
to blush.</p>

<h3><i>III.&mdash;Neighbours</i></h3>

<p>Once I lay in hospital a fortnight while an
old man died by inches across the hall. Apparently
a very painful, as it was plainly a very
tedious business. I would hear him breathing
heavily for fifteen or twenty minutes, and then
he would begin shrieking in agony and yelling
for his orderly: &ldquo;Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!&rdquo;
Now and then a nurse would come into my room
and report progress: &ldquo;The old fellow&rsquo;s kidneys
have given up; he can&rsquo;t last the night,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;I suppose the next choking spell will fetch
him.&rdquo; Thus he fought his titanic fight with the
gnawing rats of death, and thus I lay listening,
myself quickly recovering from a sanguinary
and indecent operation.... Did the shrieks
of that old man startle me, worry me, torture
me, set my nerves on edge? Not at all. I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>my meals to the accompaniment of piteous yells
to God, but day by day I ate them more heartily.
I lay still in bed and read a book or smoked
a cigar. I damned my own twinges and fading
malaises. I argued ignorantly with the surgeons.
I made polite love to the nurses who
happened in. At night I slept soundly, the noise
retreating benevolently as I dropped off. And
when the old fellow died at last, snarling and
begging for mercy with his last breath, the unaccustomed
stillness made me feel lonesome and
sad, like a child robbed of a tin whistle....
But when a young surgeon came in half an hour
later, and, having dined to his content, testified
to it by sucking his teeth, cold shudders ran
through me from stem to stern.</p>

<h3><i>IV.&mdash;From the Chart</i></h3>

<p>Temperature: 99.7. Respiration: rising to
65 and then suddenly suspended. The face is
flushed, and the eyes are glazed and half-closed.
There is obviously a sub-normal reaction to external
stimuli. A fly upon the ear is unnoticed.
The auditory nerve is anesthetic. There is a
swaying of the whole body and an apparent
failure of co-ordination, probably the effect of
some disturbance in the semi-circular canals of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>the ear. The hands tremble and then clutch
wildly. The head is inclined forward as if to
approach some object on a level with the
shoulder. The mouth stands partly open, and
the lips are puckered and damp. Of a sudden
there is a sound as of a deep and labored inspiration,
suggesting the upward curve of Cheyne-Stokes
breathing. Then comes silence for 40
seconds, followed by a quick relaxation of the
whole body and a sharp gasp....</p>

<p>One of the internes has kissed a nurse.</p>

<h3><i>V.&mdash;The Interior Hierarchy</i></h3>

<p>The world awaits that pundit who will study
at length the relative respectability of the inward
parts of man&mdash;his pipes and bellows, his
liver and lights. The inquiry will take him far
into the twilight zones of psychology. Why is
the vermiform appendix so much more virtuous
and dignified than its next-door neighbor, the
c&aelig;cum? Considered physiologically, anatomically,
pathologically, surgically, the c&aelig;cum is
the decenter of the two. It has more cleanly
habits; it is more beautiful; it serves a more
useful purpose; it brings its owner less often
to the doors of death. And yet what would one
think of a lady who mentioned her c&aelig;cum?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>But the appendix&mdash;ah, the appendix! The appendix
is pure, polite, ladylike, even noble. It
confers an unmistakable stateliness, a stamp of
position, a social consequence upon its possessor.
And, by one of the mysteries of viscerology, it
confers even <i>more</i> stateliness upon its <i>ex</i>-possessor!</p>

<p>Alas, what would you! Why is the stomach
such a libertine and outlaw in England, and so
highly respectable in the United States? No
Englishman of good breeding, save he be far
gone in liquor, ever mentions his stomach in the
presence of women, clergymen, or the Royal
Family. To avoid the necessity&mdash;for Englishmen,
too, are subject to the colic&mdash;he employs
various far-fetched euphemisms, among them,
the poetical Little Mary. No such squeamishness
is known in America. The American discusses
his stomach as freely as he discusses his
business. More, he regards its name with a
degree of respect verging upon reverence&mdash;and
so he uses it as a euphemism for the whole
region from the diaphragm to the pelvic arch.
Below his heart he has only a stomach and a
vermiform appendix.</p>

<p>In the Englishman that large region is filled
entirely by his liver, at least in polite conversation.
He never mentions his kidneys save to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>his medical adviser, but he will tell even a parlor
maid that he is feeling liverish. &ldquo;Sorry, old
chap; I&rsquo;m not up to it. Been seedy for a fortnight.
Touch of liver, I dessay. Never felt
quite fit since I came Home. Bones full of
fever. Damned old liver always kicking up.
Awfully sorry, old fellow. Awsk me again.
Glad to, pon my word.&rdquo; But never the American!
Nay, the American keeps his liver for his
secret thoughts. Hobnailed it may be, and
the most interesting thing within his frontiers,
but he would blush to mention it to a lady.</p>

<p>Myself intensely ignorant of anatomy, and
even more so of the punctilio, I yet attempted,
one rainy day, a roster of the bodily parts in
the order of their respectability. Class I was
small and exclusive; when I had put in the heart,
the brain, the hair, the eyes and the vermiform
appendix, I had exhausted all the candidates.
Here were the five aristocrats, of dignity even
in their diseases&mdash;appendicitis, angina pectoris,
aphasia, acute alcoholism, astigmatism: what a
row of a&rsquo;s! Here were the dukes, the cardinals,
nay, the princes of the blood. Here were the
supermembers; the beyond-parts.</p>

<p>In Class II I found a more motley throng,
led by the collar-bone on the one hand and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>tonsils on the other. And in Class III&mdash;but
let me present my classification and have done:</p>

<h3>CLASS II</h3>

<p>I made two more classes, VII and VIII, but
they entered into anatomical details impossible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>of discussion in a book designed to be read
aloud at the domestic hearth. Perhaps I shall
print them in the <i>Medical Times</i> at some future
time. As my classes stand, they present mysteries
enough. Why should the bronchial tubes
(Class II) be so much lordlier than the lungs
(Class III) to which they lead? And why
should the &oelig;sophagus (Class VI) be so much
<i>less</i> lordly than the stomach (Class II in the
United States, Class IV in England) to which <i>it</i>
leads? And yet the fact in each case is known
to us all. To have a touch of bronchitis is
almost fashionable; to have pneumonia is
merely bad luck. The stomach, at least in
America, is so respectable that it dignifies even
seasickness, but I have never heard of any decent
man who ever had any trouble with his
&oelig;sophagus.</p>

<p>If you wish a short cut to a strange organ&rsquo;s
standing, study its diseases. Generally speaking,
they are sure indices. Let us imagine a
problem: What is the relative respectability
of the hair and the scalp, close neighbors, offspring
of the same osseous tissue? Turn to
baldness and dandruff, and you have your answer.
To be bald is no more than a genial
jocosity, a harmless foible&mdash;but to have dandruff
is almost as bad as to have beri-beri.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Hence the fact that the hair is in Class I, while
the scalp is at the bottom of Class V. So again
and again. To break one&rsquo;s collar-bone (Class
II) is to be in harmony with the nobility and
gentry; to crack one&rsquo;s shin (Class IV) is merely
vulgar. And what a difference between having
one&rsquo;s tonsils cut out (Class II) and getting a
new set of false teeth (Class V)!</p>

<p>Wherefore? Why? To what end? Why
is the stomach so much more respectable (even
in England) than the spleen; the liver (even in
America) than the pancreas; the windpipe than
the &oelig;sophagus; the pleura than the diaphragm?
Why is the collar-bone the undisputed king of
the osseous frame? One can understand the
supremacy of the heart: it plainly bosses the
whole vascular system. But why do the bronchial
tubes wag the lungs? Why is the chin
superior to the nose? The ankles to the shins?
The solar plexus to the gall-bladder?</p>

<p>I am unequal to the penetration of this great
ethical, &aelig;sthetical and sociological mystery.
But in leaving it, let me point to another and
antagonistic one: to wit, that which concerns
those viscera of the lower animals that we use
for food. The kidneys in man are far down
the scale&mdash;far down in Class V, along with
false teeth, the scalp and the female leg. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>the kidneys of the beef steer, the calf, the sheep,
or whatever animal it is whose kidneys we eat&mdash;the
kidneys of this creature are close to the
borders of Class I. What is it that young Capt.
Lionel Basingstoke, M.P., always orders when
he drops in at Gatti&rsquo;s on his way from his
chambers in the Albany to that flat in Tyburnia
where Mrs. Vaughn-Grimsby is waiting for him
to rescue her from her <i>cochon</i> of a husband?
What else but deviled kidneys? Who ever
heard of a gallant young English seducer who
did&rsquo;t eat deviled kidneys&mdash;not now and then,
not only on Sundays and legal holidays, but
every day, every evening?</p>

<p>Again, and by way of postscript No. 2, concentrate
your mind upon sweetbreads. Sweetbreads
are made in Chicago of the pancreases
of horned cattle. From Portland to Portland
they belong to the first class of refined delicatessen.
And yet, on the human plane, the pancreas
is in Class VI, along with the c&aelig;cum
and the paunch. And, contrariwise, there is
tripe&mdash;&ldquo;the stomach of the ox or of some other
ruminant.&rdquo; The stomach of an American citizen
belongs to Class II, and even the stomach
of an Englishman is in Class IV, but tripe is
far down in Class VIII. And chitterlings&mdash;the
excised vermiform appendix of the cow. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>all the towns in Christendom, Richmond, Va.,
is the only one wherein a self-respecting white
man would dare to be caught wolfing a chitterling
in public.</p>

a woman is in itself a terrible experience.</p>

<p>History seems to bear very harshly upon
women. One cannot recall more than three
famous women who were virtuous. But on
turning to famous men the seeming injustice disappears.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>One would have difficulty finding

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<h3><i>I.&mdash;Men</i></h3>

<p>Fat, slick, round-faced men, of the sort
who haunt barber shops and are always
having their shoes shined. Tall, gloomy,
Gothic men, with eyebrows that meet over
their noses and bunches of black, curly hair in
their ears. Men wearing diamond solitaires,
fraternal order watchcharms, golden elks&rsquo; heads
with rubies for eyes. Men with thick, loose
lips and shifty eyes. Men smoking pale, spotted
cigars. Men who do not know what to do with
their hands when they talk to women. Honorable,
upright, successful men who seduce
their stenographers and are kind to their dear
old mothers. Men who allow their wives to
dress like chorus girls. White-faced, scared-looking,
yellow-eyed men who belong to societies
for the suppression of vice. Men who
boast that they neither drink nor smoke. Men
who mop their bald heads with perfumed handkerchiefs.
Men with drawn, mottled faces, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>the last stages of arterio-sclerosis. Silent,
stupid-looking men in thick tweeds who tramp
up and down the decks of ocean steamers. Men
who peep out of hotel rooms at Swedish chambermaids.
Men who go to church on Sunday
morning, carrying Oxford Bibles under their
arms. Men in dress coats too tight under the
arms. Tea-drinking men. Loud, back-slapping
men, gabbling endlessly about baseball
players. Men who have never heard of Mozart.
Tired business men with fat, glittering
wives. Men who know what to do when children
are sick. Men who believe that any
woman who smokes is a prostitute. Yellow,
diabetic men. Men whose veins are on the
outside of their noses. Now and then a clean,
clear-eyed, upstanding man. Once a week or
so a man with good shoulders, straight legs
and a hard, resolute mouth....</p>

<h3><i>II.&mdash;Women</i></h3>

<p>Fat women with flabby, double chins. Moon-faced,
pop-eyed women in little flat hats.
Women with starchy faces and thin vermilion
lips. Man-shy, suspicious women, shrinking
into their clothes every time a wet, caressing
eye alights upon them. Women soured and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>robbed of their souls by Christian Endeavor.
Women who would probably be members of
the Lake Mohonk Conference if they were
men. Gray-haired, middle-aged, waddling women,
wrecked and unsexed by endless, useless
parturition, nursing, worry, sacrifice. Women
who look as if they were still innocent yesterday
afternoon. Women in shoes that bend their insteps
to preposterous semi-circles. Women
with green, barbaric bangles in their ears, like
the concubines of Arab horse-thieves. Women
looking in show-windows, wishing that their
husbands were not such poor sticks. Shapeless
women lolling in six thousand dollar motorcars.
Trig little blondes, stepping like Shetland
ponies. Women smelling of musk, ambergris,
bergamot. Long-legged, cadaverous, hungry
women. Women eager to be kidnapped, betrayed,
forced into marriage at the pistol&rsquo;s
point. Soft, pulpy, pale women. Women with
ginger-colored hair and large, irregular
freckles. Silly, chattering, gurgling women.
Women showing their ankles to policemen,
chauffeurs, street-cleaners. Women with slim-shanked,
whining, sticky-fingered children
dragging after them. Women marching like
grenadiers. Yellow women. Women with red
hands. Women with asymmetrical eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>Women with rococo ears. Stoop-shouldered
women. Women with huge hips. Bow-legged
women. Appetizing women. Good-looking
women....</p>

<h3><i>III.&mdash;Babies</i></h3>

<p>Babies smelling of camomile tea, cologne water,
wet laundry, dog soap, <i>Schmierkase</i>. Babies
who appear old, disillusioned and tired of life
at six months. Babies that cry "Papa!" to
blushing youths of nineteen or twenty at church
picnics. Fat babies whose earlobes turn out at
an angle of forty-five degrees. Soft, pulpy
babies asleep in perambulators, the sun shining
straight into their faces. Babies gnawing the
tails of synthetic dogs. Babies without necks.
Pale, scorbutic babies of the third and fourth
generation, damned because their grandfathers
and great-grandfathers read Tom Paine.
Babies of a bluish tinge, or with vermilion
eyes. Babies full of soporifics. Thin, cartilaginous
babies that stretch when they are
lifted. Warm, damp, miasmatic babies. Affectionate,
ingratiating, gurgling babies: the
<i>larv&aelig;</i> of life insurance solicitors, fashionable
doctors, Episcopal rectors, dealers in Mexican
mine stock, hand-shakers, Sunday-school superintendents.
Hungry babies, absurdly sucking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>their thumbs. Babies with heads of thick,
coarse black hair, seeming to be toupees. Unbaptized
babies, dedicated to the devil. Eugenic
babies. Babies that crawl out from under
tables and are stepped on. Babies with lintels,
grains of corn or shoe-buttons up their noses,
purple in the face and waiting for the doctor or
the embalmer. A few pink, blue-eyed, tight-skinned,
clean-looking babies, smiling upon the
world....</p>

<i>Scene Infernal.</i></h3>

<p>During a lull in the uproar of Hell two voices
were heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;was Ludwig van
Beethoven. I was no ordinary musician. The
Archduke Rudolph used to speak to me on the
streets of Vienna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;was the Archduke
Rudolph. I was no ordinary archduke.
Ludwig van Beethoven dedicated a trio to me.&rdquo;</p>

<i>The Eternal Democrat.</i></h3>

<p>A Socialist, carrying a red flag, marched
through the gates of Heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Hell with rank!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;All
men are equal here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the late Karl Marx turned a corner
and came into view, meditatively stroking
his whiskers. At once the Socialist fell upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>his knees and touched his forehead to the dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Master!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;O Master, Master!&rdquo;</p>

<i>The School of Honor.</i></h3>

<p>A trembling young reporter stood in the presence
of an eminent city editor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I write this story,&rdquo; said the reporter,
&ldquo;it will rob a woman of her good name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t write it,&rdquo; said the city editor,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a kick in the pantaloons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day the young reporter got a raise in
salary and the woman swallowed two ounces
of permanganate of potassium.</p>

<i>Proposed Plot For a Modern Novel.</i></h3>

<p>Herman was in love with Violet, the wife of

Violet, who were Christians, awaited with virtuous
patience the termination of Armand&rsquo;s distressing
malady.</p>
